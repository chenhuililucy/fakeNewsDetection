And Jolie has been consistently seeing one particular non-famous, handsome real estate agent, according to Entertainment Tonight. \"It's not serious,\" the outlet's source cautioned off the bat. \"Brad and Angie are both very secretive about their dating life. Angie has told some friends she isn't ready to date, but she has been seeing a handsome, older-looking man who is a real estate agent. He isn't a celebrity or high profile in any way.\"\n\nThis content is imported from poll. You may be able to find the same content in another format, or you may be able to find more information, at their web site.\n\nApparently Jolie is super psyched to just have an adult around. \"Angie was in a very bad place after [her] split [from Brad],\" the source said. \"Just having another adult to spend time with has been helpful.\"\n\nThe source also stressed that a Brangelina reconciliation is most certainly never ever happening, sorry. \"People talk about them reuniting, but it will never happen,\" the source said. \"Things between Brad and Angie really ended poorly, and while they've attempted therapy with the [six] children [they share], they can barely be in the same room together.\"\n\nMore From ELLE\n\nPitt, meanwhile, is also dating, also secretly. \"He's very private about who he\u2019s seeing, but he does continue to casually date. The women he sees are not in the public eye,\" a second source told the outlet.", "images": ["http://www.elle.com/_assets/design-tokens/fre/static/icons/social/pinterest.e8cf655.svg?primary=%2523ffffff&id=social-button-icon", "https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/cardi-b-and-offset-attending-the-vanity-fair-oscar-party-news-photo-1694355966.jpg?crop=0.893xw:0.595xh;0.0417xw,0.0823xh&resize=360:*", "http://www.elle.com/_assets/design-tokens/fre/static/icons/social/youtube.ce3e1ae.svg?primary=%2523ffffff&id=social-button-icon", "https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/gettyimages-1738323608-652d36a44c564.jpg?crop=0.829xw:1.00xh;0.0865xw,0&resize=360:*", "https://hips.hearstapps.com/vidthumb/images/elle-burn-ballads-babyface-ak-v1-65283d375ffe8.jpg?crop=1xw:1xh;center,top&resize=480:*", "https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/madelyn-cline-sofia-hublitz-and-pete-davidson-are-seen-in-news-photo-1697380465.jpg?crop=0.909xw:0.606xh;0.0529xw,0.0716xh&resize=360:*", "https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/gettyimages-912329530-1522099550.jpg?crop=1.00xw:0.753xh;0,0.0611xh&resize=1200:*", "https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/selena-gomez-gettyimages-1699488086-652d70db4a057.jpg?crop=0.668xw:1.00xh;0.160xw,0&resize=360:*", "http://www.elle.com/_assets/design-tokens/fre/static/icons/social/twitter.c44156b.svg?primary=%2523ffffff&id=social-button-icon", "https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/justin-bieber-and-hailey-bieber-attend-the-2021-met-gala-news-photo-1631970523.jpg?crop=0.771xw:1.00xh;0.115xw,0&resize=360:*", "https://hips.hearstapps.com/rover/profile_photos/67f50b99-742e-4e5d-8197-6e717b23ab3b.jpg?fill=1:1&resize=120:*", "https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/jake-bongiovi-and-british-actress-millie-bobby-brown-arrive-news-photo-1672425305.jpg?crop=0.571xw:0.800xh;0.151xw,0.0449xh&resize=360:*", "https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/frankie-grande-as-frank-n-furter-and-sister-ariana-grande-news-photo-1697392158.jpg?crop=0.825xw:0.580xh;0.0321xw,0.0169xh&resize=360:*", "https://hips.hearstapps.com/rover/profile_photos/67f50b99-742e-4e5d-8197-6e717b23ab3b.jpg?fill=1:1&resize=160:*", "https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/chris-evans-speaks-at-a-spotlight-panel-during-new-york-news-photo-1697383654.jpg?crop=0.780xw:0.520xh;0.0705xw,0.0576xh&resize=360:*", "https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/prince-harry-duke-of-sussex-and-meghan-duchess-of-sussex-news-photo-1697473263.jpg?crop=1.00xw:0.731xh;0,0.0152xh&resize=360:*", "http://www.elle.com/_assets/design-tokens/fre/static/icons/social/facebook.a5a3a69.svg?primary=%2523ffffff&id=social-button-icon", "http://www.elle.com/_assets/design-tokens/fre/static/icons/social/instagram.f282b14.svg?primary=%2523ffffff&id=social-button-icon", "http://www.elle.com/_assets/design-tokens/fre/static/icons/social/pinterest.e8cf655.svg?primary=%2523ffffff", "http://www.elle.com/_assets/design-tokens/elle/static/images/logos/logo.2856426.svg?primary=%2523ffffff", "https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/chris-alba-img-9670-1676401473.jpg?crop=1.00xw:0.757xh;0,0.243xh&resize=360:*", "https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/priyanka-chopra-jonas-and-nick-jonas-pose-backstage-at-the-news-photo-1697387669.jpg?crop=0.934xw:0.706xh;0.0208xw,0.0508xh&resize=360:*", "https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/millie-bobby-brown-jake-bongiovi-gettyimages-1673812984-652d89c52f4e5.jpg?crop=1.00xw:0.668xh;0,0.0513xh&resize=360:*", "http://www.elle.com/_assets/design-tokens/elle/static/images/logos/network-logo.242fea1.svg?primary=%2523ffffff", "https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/gettyimages-912329530-1522099550.jpg?crop=1.00xw:0.753xh;0,0.0519xh&resize=640:*", "http://www.elle.com/_assets/design-tokens/elle/static/images/logos/logo.2856426.svg?primary=navLogoColor"], "top_img": "https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/gettyimages-912329530-1522099550.jpg?crop=1.00xw:0.753xh;0,0.0611xh&resize=1200:*", "keywords": [], "authors": [], "canonical_link": "https://www.elle.com/culture/celebrities/a19600845/angelina-jolie-is-secretly-dating-real-estate-agent-report/", "title": "Angelina Jolie Is Secretly Dating Real Estate Agent", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "X-UA-Compatible": "IE=edge,chrom=1", "msapplication-tap-highlight": "no", "title": "Angelina Jolie Is Secretly Dating Real Estate Agent - Brangelina Not Getting Back Together", "description": "The truest sign Brangelina is legitimately, absolutely over has just come out: both Angelina Jolie and Brad Pitt are quietly dating other people.

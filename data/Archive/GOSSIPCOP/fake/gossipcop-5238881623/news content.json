Announced two days after the president\u2019s rally in Phoenix, the pardon comes before Arpaio, who spoke at last year\u2019s Republican National Convention, has even been sentenced following his July conviction of criminal contempt for disregarding a court order in a racial profiling case. In defense of the move, the administration is citing Arpaio\u2019s long history of military and law enforcement service.\n\nMany celebrities and political figures strongly criticized the moves and their timing on social media, calling the president a \u201cracist,\u201d \u201cmonster,\u201d and \u201cdisgusting.\u201d\n\n\u201cTransgender Ban & Arpaio pardon on the same day, hiding behind the news of Hurricane Harvey,\u201d tweeted House of Cards creator Beau Willimon. \u201c@realDonaldTrump is a hateful, cowardly menace.\u201d", "images": ["https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F6%2F2023%2F08%2F29%2FDoctor-Who-082923-2.jpg", "data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%20100%2067'%3E%3C/svg%3E", "data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%20100%20100'%3E%3C/svg%3E", "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Few.com%2Fimg%2Fmisc%2F300x250_magazines_and_more.jpg", "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F6%2F2023%2F09%2F06%2Fbig-fat-greek-wedding09062349.jpg", "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F6%2F2023%2F09%2F08%2Fbest-football-movies-tout-090723.jpg", "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F6%2F2017%2F08%2Fdonald-trump-joe-arpaio-2000.jpg", "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F6%2F2018%2F12%2F21%2Fderek_160.jpg", "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?q=60&c=sc&poi=face&w=2000&h=1000&url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F6%2F2017%2F08%2Fdonald-trump-joe-arpaio-2000.jpg"], "top_img": "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?q=60&c=sc&poi=face&w=2000&h=1000&url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F6%2F2017%2F08%2Fdonald-trump-joe-arpaio-2000.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Derek Lawrence", "August", "At Pm Edt"], "canonical_link": "https://ew.com/news/2017/08/25/celebs-react-trump-pardon-joe-arpaio/", "title": "Celebs rip 'racist' and 'cowardly' Trump for pardoning former Arizona Sheriff Joe Arpaio", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "theme-color": "#111", "keywords": "entertainment, entertainment news, ew, entertainment weekly", "news_keywords": "entertainment, entertainment news, ew, entertainment weekly", "description": "Don Cheadle, Debra Messing, and more ripped Trump for his many controversial decisions on Friday.", "robots": "max-image-preview:large", "og": {"title": "Celebs Rip 'Racist' and 'Cowardly' Trump for Pardoning Former Arizona Sheriff Joe Arpaio", "type": "article", "site_name": "EW.com", "url": "https://ew.com/news/2017/08/25/celebs-react-trump-pardon-joe-arpaio/", "description": "Don Cheadle, Debra Messing, and more ripped Trump for his many controversial decisions on Friday.", "image": {"identifier": "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?q=60&c=sc&poi=face&w=2000&h=1000&url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F6%2F2017%2F08%2Fdonald-trump-joe-arpaio-2000.jpg", "width": 2000, "height": 1000}}, "pinterest": {"url": "https://ew.com/news/2017/08/25/celebs-react-trump-pardon-joe-arpaio/", "media": "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F6%2F2017%2F08%2Fdonald-trump-joe-arpaio-2000.jpg"}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "url": "https://ew.com/news/2017/08/25/celebs-react-trump-pardon-joe-arpaio/", "title": "Celebs Rip 'Racist' and 'Cowardly' Trump for Pardoning Former Arizona Sheriff Joe Arpaio", "description": "Don Cheadle, Debra Messing, and more ripped Trump for his many controversial decisions on Friday.", "site": "@ew", "image": "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?q=60&c=sc&poi=face&w=2000&h=1000&url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F6%2F2017%2F08%2Fdonald-trump-joe-arpaio-2000.jpg"}, "fb": {"app_id": 2485718348341688, "pages": 52150999700}, "article": {"opinion": "false"}, "url": "https://ew.com/news/2017/08/25/celebs-react-trump-pardon-joe-arpaio/"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1503590400.0, "source": "http://ew.com", "summary": ""}

The article, titled \u201cLife After Heartbreak,\u201d seemingly presents itself as an interview with Garner, but instead references insiders and sources who claim her split with Ben Affleck has \u201cbeen the most difficult decision for her.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAnother insists Garner will \u201ceventually\u201d start dating again. \u201cShe\u2019s certainly not jumping up and down and screaming, \u2018I\u2019m single!\u2019 and planning dates,\u201d the source says. \u201cShe still says Ben was the love of her life.\u201d\n\nGarner was quick to respond to the story, writing in a statement, \u201cI did not pose for this cover. I did not participate in or authorize this article.\u201d\n\nPeople\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe 45-year-old adds that although this \u201cisn\u2019t a tragedy by any measure\u201d it does affect herself and her young children with Affleck \u2015 Violet, Seraphina and Samuel.\n\n\u201cWhile we are here, for what it\u2019s worth: I have three wonderful kids and my family is complete,\u201d she joked of those frequent pregnancy reports.", "images": ["https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/59300fa9140000200048032a.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale", "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/58f4e7251b0000330016bde3.png?cache=BkucldEjt8&ops=scalefit_960_noupscale", "https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6723616&c3=&c4=&c5=&c6=&c15=&cj=1", "https://www.facebook.com/tr?id=1621685564716533&ev=PageView&noscript=1", "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/593009d62100002b006fed11.jpeg?cache=5WwHBXwb1w&ops=1200_630", "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5c40e65d260000a200faeb76.jpg?ops=100_100", "http://pixel.quantserve.com/pixel/p-3aud4J6uA4Z6Y.gif", "data:image/png;base64,iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAAAAEAAAABCAQAAAC1HAwCAAAAC0lEQVR42mNkYAAAAAYAAjCB0C8AAAAASUVORK5CYII="], "top_img": "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/593009d62100002b006fed11.jpeg?cache=5WwHBXwb1w&ops=1200_630", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Senior Entertainment Reporter"], "canonical_link": "https://www.huffpost.com/entry/jennifer-garner-denounces-people-magazine-cover-story-about-divorce_n_593007c1e4b09ec37c3203e3", "title": "Jennifer Garner Denounces People Magazine Cover Story About Divorce", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, minimum-scale=1.0", "description": "\"I did not pose for this cover.

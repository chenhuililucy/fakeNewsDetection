National Enquirer is the first to claim that the Oscar-winning actor \"has been dragged into an FBI probe, after gifting stunned dinner party guests with $1 MILLION in cash stuffed in a designer bag!\"\n\nThe publication claims that there's a \"hush-hush government investigation\" surrounding the \"Money Monster\" actor and \"the hoity-toity dinner party that spawned it.\" The alleged event was reported being held to celebrate the success of his tequila line, Casamigos.\n\nThe publication further contends Clooney, who is known for his \"generous nature,\" had a \"desire to spread the wealth.\" It goes on citing a so-called source as saying, \"Being the practical joker he is, George would've known that doling out $1 million in cash to each guest would've caused some intrigue and embarrassment when they went to deposit the money at a bank.\"\n\n\"There is a protocol, and the FBI would've been called in to question the depositor,\" the insider continued, before adding, \"But in the end, it was proven that George did, in fact, throw a party and gave everyone $1 million in cash, not to mention a designer bag.\" The insider asserts, \"This is the last thing that George needs right now. He's got twins on the way and G-men at his proverbial doorstep!\"\n\nHowever, Gossip Cop has debunked all of the above allegations. The site can confirm that there's no real probe or scandal, and Clooney has not attracted any \"federal attention.\" A representative for the \"Ocean's Eleven\" star tells the site that the story made by National Enquirer \"is fabricated.\"\n\nYou can share this post!", "images": ["http://www.aceshowbiz.com/display/images/300x188/2023/10/17/00213526.webp", "http://www.aceshowbiz.com/display/images/119x83/2023/10/16/00213457.webp", "http://www.aceshowbiz.com/display/images/300x188/2023/10/17/00213516.webp", "http://www.aceshowbiz.com/assets/img/logo.png", "http://www.aceshowbiz.com/display/images/119x83/2023/10/16/00213431.webp", "http://www.aceshowbiz.com/display/images/300x188/2023/10/17/00213534.webp", "http://www.aceshowbiz.com/display/images/119x83/2023/10/16/00213432.webp", "http://www.aceshowbiz.com/display/images/119x83/2023/10/16/00213442.webp", "http://www.aceshowbiz.com/images/news/generous-george-clooney-under-fbi-investigation-for-money-laundering.jpg", "http://www.aceshowbiz.com/display/images/119x83/2023/10/16/00213436.webp", "http://www.aceshowbiz.com/display/images/300x188/2023/10/17/00213518.webp", "http://www.aceshowbiz.com/display/images/90x60/2023/09/29/00212635.webp", "http://www.aceshowbiz.com/display/images/119x83/2023/10/16/00213451.webp", "http://www.aceshowbiz.com/display/images/119x83/2023/10/16/00213438.webp", "http://www.aceshowbiz.com/display/images/90x60/2023/07/15/00208546.jpg", "http://www.aceshowbiz.com/display/images/300x188/2023/10/17/00213517.webp", "http://www.aceshowbiz.com/display/images/300x188/2023/10/17/00213522.webp", "http://www.aceshowbiz.com/display/images/119x83/2023/10/15/00213421.webp", "https://www.aceshowbiz.com/images/news/generous-george-clooney-under-fbi-investigation-for-money-laundering.jpg", "http://www.aceshowbiz.com/display/images/90x60/2023/09/24/00212323.webp", "http://www.aceshowbiz.com/display/images/90x60/2023/09/03/00211200.webp", "http://www.aceshowbiz.com/display/images/300x400/2023/10/15/00213429.webp"], "top_img": "https://www.aceshowbiz.com/images/news/generous-george-clooney-under-fbi-investigation-for-money-laundering.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Aceshowbiz Team"], "canonical_link": "https://www.aceshowbiz.com/news/view/00107228.html", "title": "Report: Generous George Clooney Under FBI Investigation for Money Laundering", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "description": "The Oscar-winning actor reportedly 'has been dragged into an FBI probe, after gifting stunned dinner party guests with [1 million dollar] in cash stuffed in a designer bag!'", "author": "AceShowbiz Team", "fb": {"app_id": 320088948016615}, "og": {"title": "Report: Generous George Clooney Under FBI Investigation for Money Laundering", "type": "article", "url": "https://www.aceshowbiz.com/news/view/00107228.html", "image": {"identifier": "https://www.aceshowbiz.com/images/news/generous-george-clooney-under-fbi-investigation-for-money-laundering.jpg", "alt": "Report: Generous George Clooney Under FBI Investigation for Money Laundering"}, "site_name": "AceShowbiz", "description": "The Oscar-winning actor reportedly 'has been dragged into an FBI probe, after gifting stunned dinner party guests with [1 million dollar] in cash stuffed in a designer bag!'"}, "twitter": {"title": "Report: Generous George Clooney Under FBI Investigation for Money Laundering", "description": "The Oscar-winning actor reportedly 'has been dragged into an FBI probe, after gifting stunned dinner party guests with [1 million dollar] in cash stuffed in a designer bag!'", "image": "https://www.aceshowbiz.com/images/news/generous-george-clooney-under-fbi-investigation-for-money-laundering.jpg", "card": "summary_large_image", "site": "@aceshowbiz", "creator": "@aceshowbiz", "domain": "aceshowbiz.com"}, "googlebot-news": "index,follow", "googlebot": "index,follow", "robots": "index, follow, max-image-preview:large", "language": "en", "geo.country": "US", "apple-mobile-web-app-capable": "yes", "apple-mobile-web-app-status-bar-style": "black", "theme-color": "#5F256F", "facebook-domain-verification": "w1cnp2fiw07juij7ioh13nr1t76oqf"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": null, "source": "http://www.aceshowbiz.com", "summary": ""}

Multiple reports are claiming that Jennifer Lawrence and Brad Pitt are now dating.\n\nBoth stars are newly single, Lawrence recently split from director boyfriend Darren Aronofsky and Pitt is in the process of divorcing longtime partner and wife of two years, Angelia Jolie.\n\nRumors of their romance began on Wednesday and the story graces the cover of this week\u2019s issue of Star Magazine. Sources told the publication that \u201cBrad has had his eye on Jennifer for years. [They] have been enjoying lots of late nights together. There\u2019s an intense connection between them!\u201d\n\nAn insider also told the magazine that Pitt allegedly reached out to Lawrence after getting her phone number from a mutual friend. The source added that Pitt was nervous to contact Lawrence, but was encouraged by friends to make the first move.\n\nHowever, the tabloid checking website Gossip Cop reported that despite reports about the two A-listers becoming a pair, for now the rumors remain just rumors.\n\nAccording to The Sun, Lawrence broke up with Aronofsy after a year of dating due to their great difference in age. But age hasn\u2019t seemed to stop Lawrence before. Before dating Aronofsky, Lawrence had a short fling with Coldplay lead singer and ex-husband a Gwyneth Paltrow, Chris Martin \u2014 Paltrow being another common thread between her and Brad.\n\nPrior to dating Martin, Lawrence dated her 28-year-old \u201cX-Men\u201d co-star, Nicolas Hoult, for five years off and on. The two ended their relationship in August of 2014.\n\nThe Sun also reported that sources close to Pitt have denied the dating rumors and said that he and Lawrence are not together.", "images": ["https://a57.foxnews.com/cf-images.us-east-1.prod.boltdns.net/v1/static/694940094001/bc0139ed-dfd3-48a4-a787-513ea68e0bd2/fc54e451-80ea-47ff-91b1-de54099e23d8/1280x720/match/348/196/image.jpg?ve=1&tl=1", "https://a57.foxnews.com/static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2018/09/1200/675/bradjenfeature.jpg?ve=1&tl=1", "https://a57.foxnews.com/cf-images.us-east-1.prod.boltdns.net/v1/static/694940094001/83b2d775-69cc-4848-8b74-95264ed0e619/9d1d2ef8-ce77-49be-a72a-fd1bc5066852/1280x720/match/348/196/image.jpg?ve=1&tl=1", "https://a57.foxnews.com/cf-images.us-east-1.prod.boltdns.net/v1/static/694940094001/3e9ced2e-531b-4cf9-b018-8211b0cd9c9f/ab1462d0-9a4f-43fa-8ac5-cad4334f6423/1280x720/match/348/196/image.jpg?ve=1&tl=1", "https://a57.foxnews.com/cf-images.us-east-1.prod.boltdns.net/v1/static/694940094001/183b2f7a-c7f3-4997-9aa1-dd56b237447c/c979f515-7a54-4ca7-be52-59fb1d57c87c/1280x720/match/348/196/image.jpg?ve=1&tl=1", "https://a57.foxnews.com/cf-images.us-east-1.prod.boltdns.net/v1/static/694940094001/56e6701b-75a0-4604-a058-d6f860e0a91e/ab06fb93-f483-4405-9236-524a310f9dd8/1280x720/match/348/196/image.jpg?ve=1&tl=1", "https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2018/09/bradjenfeature.jpg", "http://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2022/11/NEWSLETTER_ENT-532x120.png", "https://a57.foxnews.com/static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2023/10/348/196/GettyImages-1382699992.jpg?ve=1&tl=1"], "top_img": "https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2018/09/bradjenfeature.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Morgan Evans"], "canonical_link": "https://www.foxnews.com/entertainment/are-brad-pitt-and-jennifer-lawrence-dating", "title": "Are Brad Pitt and Jennifer Lawrence dating?", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, minimum-scale=1.0, initial-scale=1.0", "msapplication-square70x70logo": "//static.foxnews.com/static/orion/styles/img/fox-news/favicons/mstile-70x70.png", "msapplication-square150x150logo": "//static.foxnews.com/static/orion/styles/img/fox-news/favicons/mstile-150x150.png", "msapplication-square310x310logo": "//static.foxnews.com/static/orion/styles/img/fox-news/favicons/mstile-310x310.png", "msapplication-wide310x150logo": "//static.foxnews.com/static/orion/styles/img/fox-news/favicons/mstile-310x150.png", "description": "Rumors of their reported romance began on Wednesday and grace the cover of this week\u2019s issue of Star Magazine.", "prism.channel": "fnc", "prism.section": "entertainment", "prism.aggregationType": "subsection", "pagetype": "article", "content-creator": "tiger", "dc.creator": "Morgan Evans", "dc.title": "Are Brad Pitt and Jennifer Lawrence dating?", "dcterms.abstract": "Rumors of their reported romance began on Wednesday and grace the cover of this week\u2019s issue of Star Magazine.", "dc.type": "Text.Article", "dc.description": "Rumors of their reported romance began on Wednesday and grace the cover of this week\u2019s issue of Star Magazine.", "dc.language": "en-US", "dc.publisher": "Fox News", "dc.format": "text/html", "dc.identifier": "urn:uri:base64:5d6d73ac-d84d-55f1-821d-befd10265d7a", "dc.source": "Fox News", "dc.date": "2017-12-13", "dcterms.created": "2017-12-13T13:23:40-05:00", "dcterms.modified": "2017-12-13T15:40:01-05:00", "og": {"title": "Are Brad Pitt and Jennifer Lawrence dating?", "description": "Rumors of their reported romance began on Wednesday and grace the cover of this week\u2019s issue of Star Magazine.", "type": "article", "image": "https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2018/09/bradjenfeature.jpg", "url": "https://www.foxnews.com/entertainment/are-brad-pitt-and-jennifer-lawrence-dating", "site_name": "Fox News"}, "robots": "index, follow, max-image-preview:large, max-video-preview:-1", "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "site": "@foxnews", "title": "Are Brad Pitt and Jennifer Lawrence dating?", "description": "Rumors of their reported romance began on Wednesday and grace the cover of this week\u2019s issue of Star Magazine.", "image": "https://a57.foxnews.com/static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2018/09/1024/512/bradjenfeature.jpg?ve=1&tl=1", "url": "https://www.foxnews.com/entertainment/are-brad-pitt-and-jennifer-lawrence-dating"}, "fb": {"app_id": 113186182048399}, "article": {"opinion": "false"}, "classification": "/FOX NEWS/ENTERTAINMENT/EVENTS/Couples,/FOX NEWS/ENTERTAINMENT", "classification-isa": "couples,entertainment", "classification-tags": "couples,entertainment"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1513094400.0, "source": "http://www.foxnews.com", "summary": ""}

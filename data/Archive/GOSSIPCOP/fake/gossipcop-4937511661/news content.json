TMZ has confirmed.\n\nSources connected with the family tell us the twins were born Tuesday in a Los Angeles hospital. We're told a \"minor issue\" surfaced, and as a result ... doctors do not feel comfortable releasing them.\n\nWe do not know the nature of the issue.\n\nOne source told us Beyonce also remains at the hospital, but as far as we know she's okay. The babies are expected to be okay as well.", "images": ["https://imagez.tmz.com/image/de/16by9/2023/10/16/de25fc06e5c2487696d00eeeecb0db90_xs.jpg",

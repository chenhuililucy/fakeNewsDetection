This week, we focus on the beauty and brains that is Angelina Jolie. Here are eleven reasons we love this superstar.\n\n1. Have you seen her?\n\nYes, admit it. She\u2019s gorgeous.\n\n2. Her body of work.\n\nAngie\u2019s body of work is pretty impressive, ranging from strong badass women in films like Wanted to brilliant character depictions like Girl, Interrupted. She is arguably one of the best actresses working at the moment.\n\n3. Her dedication to her family.\n\nThey go everywhere with her. All of them. ALL OF THEM!\n\n4. Her humanitarian campaigns.\n\nAngie in the past has worked as a UN ambassador drawing attention to war torn areas across the globe. She is also a spokeswoman on rape during war and works tirelessly to help children who are harmed by war. These are just a few of Angie\u2019s campaigns for which she has been honoured for on many an occasion. Oh, and after her visit to Cambodia, SHE called the UN to ask how she could help.\n\n5. Taking the director\u2019s seat.\n\nOn top of a huge workload in acting, Angie has now moved into the director\u2019s seat for In the Land of Blood and Honey and the upcoming Unbroken.\n\n6. She\u2019s one half of one of our favourite couples.\n\nBrad! BRAD AND ANGIE! Too much.\n\n7. That Oscar speech.\n\nAdorable.\n\n8. She\u2019s a little bit left of centre.\n\nYes, she went around with a vial full of her other half\u2019s blood, but you know what? Angelina doesn\u2019t really care what you think.\n\n9. She\u2019s brave.\n\nThe actress underwent a double mastectomy last year, but she also came clean about it in the press, a very brave decision for the actress and an inspirational story for many others.\n\n10. Those lips!\n\nThey are hers. Honestly.\n\n11. She is completely badass.\n\nLara Croft? Salt? Wanted? Mr. and Mrs. Smith? We wouldn\u2019t want to get in a fight with Angie, that\u2019s all we know.", "images": ["https://her.ie/uploads/2023/09/28155837/GettyImages-1349984103.jpg?height=106&width=212&cropped",

Hemsworth even went so far as to deny to the press they were re-engaged, despite Cyrus wearing his ring. But time and going Instagram official must change all, because Cyrus very openly spoke about her life living with Hemsworth to Jimmy Kimmel last night.\n\nShe touched on the viral videos they've shared of Hemsworth pranking her, which is apparently a regular occurrence for the two. \"Yes, constantly [Liam likes to scare me],\" Cyrus said. About that last video he posted this week, she explained her, \"F*ck you, I hate you, I was already scared\" reaction.\n\n\"I was, I was already scared,\" she said. \"That was what was so annoying. I was putting\u2014and this was bad, I know that it\u2019s May, and I was putting our Christmas decorations away finally. I like lights, and I like shiny things and elves, and they just live for like a whole summer. So now it was time, May 1, Christmas has gotta go.\" Kimmel expressed his shock she still had the decorations up. \"They\u2019re so cute. Santa makes me feel safe.\"\n\nMore From ELLE\n\n\"So I was already in this really creepy basement and so I was coming up to say \u2018Oh my god, that basement is so scary,\u2019 and then he jumped out at the worst time,\" Cyrus continued. She dodged Kimmel's question of whether she's bothered by it or actually okay with it. \"I just don\u2019t know why I haven\u2019t caught onto this is all\u2014but I don\u2019t know he\u2019s around every corner. He\u2019s around a lot of corners,\" she said. And she can't get him back. \"I\u2019m obviously very loud so I\u2019m not good at scaring people. because I\u2019m like\u2014\" Cyrus hiss-laughs manically, \"And he\u2019s like \u2018I can hear you back there behind the door.\u2019\"\n\nShe revealed to Kimmel that yes, they're living together, and Hemsworth also calls her a hoarder. \"I\u2019m very, okay, I would say I\u2019m a clean person but I\u2019m also am a little bit of a hoarder. He calls it hoarding, I call it collecting. There\u2019s a very small\u2014there\u2019s a thin line that divides hoarding and collecting, [and it] is keeping things in the package. So having things in the boxes, so for example, I have saved for probably 15 years now a bag of peanuts from Southwest airlines, but they\u2019re still in the bag so that is collecting. Loose peanuts, that\u2019s hoarding. Collecting is in the package because they mean something to me. [The peanuts], they represent the beginning of this life for me because I was on my way to LA for the first time to audition for Hannah Montana.\"\n\nThis content is imported from poll. You may be able to find the same content in another format, or you may be able to find more information, at their web site.\n\n\n\n\n\nAnd finally, Hemsworth got her hooked on video games. \"This is really random, you\u2019d never expect this, but Liam was playing the UFC [fighting] video game, and I told him how dumb it was until the controller got in my hand one time, and now it\u2019s my favorite thing in the world is smoking pot and playing UFC video games. It\u2019s not very productive.\"\n\nBecause this is a Miley Cyrus interview, she also touched on her pot use these days: still none. \"I want to be but no, [I\u2019m no longer smoking].\" Kimmel pointed out pot is now legal in California. \"That\u2019s the way I\u2014I\u2019m a rebel. Because I am very focused on what I\u2019m working on right now and I think I also think it is the most magical, amazing\u2014it\u2019s my first and true love, but it\u2019s not for me at this time in my life, but I\u2019m sure there will be a day I will happily indulge.", "images": ["http://www.elle.com/_assets/design-tokens/fre/static/icons/social/pinterest.e8cf655.svg?primary=%2523ffffff&id=social-button-icon", "https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/cardi-b-and-offset-attending-the-vanity-fair-oscar-party-news-photo-1694355966.jpg?crop=0.893xw:0.595xh;0.0417xw,0.0823xh&resize=360:*", "http://www.elle.com/_assets/design-tokens/fre/static/icons/social/instagram.f282b14.svg?primary=currentColor&id=link-out-embed", "http://www.elle.com/_assets/design-tokens/fre/static/icons/social/youtube.ce3e1ae.svg?primary=%2523ffffff&id=social-button-icon", "https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/gettyimages-1738323608-652d36a44c564.jpg?crop=0.829xw:1.00xh;0.0865xw,0&resize=360:*", "https://hips.hearstapps.com/vidthumb/images/elle-burn-ballads-babyface-ak-v1-65283d375ffe8.jpg?crop=1xw:1xh;center,top&resize=480:*", "https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/madelyn-cline-sofia-hublitz-and-pete-davidson-are-seen-in-news-photo-1697380465.jpg?crop=0.909xw:0.606xh;0.0529xw,0.0716xh&resize=360:*", "https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/selena-gomez-gettyimages-1699488086-652d70db4a057.jpg?crop=0.668xw:1.00xh;0.160xw,0&resize=360:*", "http://www.elle.com/_assets/design-tokens/fre/static/icons/social/twitter.c44156b.svg?primary=%2523ffffff&id=social-button-icon", "http://www.elle.com/_assets/design-tokens/fre/static/icons/social/youtube.ce3e1ae.svg?primary=currentColor&id=link-out-embed", "https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/justin-bieber-and-hailey-bieber-attend-the-2021-met-gala-news-photo-1631970523.jpg?crop=0.771xw:1.00xh;0.115xw,0&resize=360:*", "https://hips.hearstapps.com/rover/profile_photos/67f50b99-742e-4e5d-8197-6e717b23ab3b.jpg?fill=1:1&resize=120:*", "https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/jake-bongiovi-and-british-actress-millie-bobby-brown-arrive-news-photo-1672425305.jpg?crop=0.571xw:0.800xh;0.151xw,0.0449xh&resize=360:*", "https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/frankie-grande-as-frank-n-furter-and-sister-ariana-grande-news-photo-1697392158.jpg?crop=0.825xw:0.580xh;0.0321xw,0.0169xh&resize=360:*", "https://hips.hearstapps.com/rover/profile_photos/67f50b99-742e-4e5d-8197-6e717b23ab3b.jpg?fill=1:1&resize=160:*", "https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/chris-evans-speaks-at-a-spotlight-panel-during-new-york-news-photo-1697383654.jpg?crop=0.780xw:0.520xh;0.0705xw,0.0576xh&resize=360:*", "https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/prince-harry-duke-of-sussex-and-meghan-duchess-of-sussex-news-photo-1697473263.jpg?crop=1.00xw:0.731xh;0,0.0152xh&resize=360:*", "http://www.elle.com/_assets/design-tokens/fre/static/icons/social/facebook.a5a3a69.svg?primary=%2523ffffff&id=social-button-icon", "http://www.elle.com/_assets/design-tokens/fre/static/icons/social/instagram.f282b14.svg?primary=%2523ffffff&id=social-button-icon", "http://www.elle.com/_assets/design-tokens/fre/static/icons/social/pinterest.e8cf655.svg?primary=%2523ffffff", "http://www.elle.com/_assets/design-tokens/elle/static/images/logos/logo.2856426.svg?primary=%2523ffffff", "https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/chris-alba-img-9670-1676401473.jpg?crop=1.00xw:0.757xh;0,0.243xh&resize=360:*", "https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/priyanka-chopra-jonas-and-nick-jonas-pose-backstage-at-the-news-photo-1697387669.jpg?crop=0.934xw:0.706xh;0.0208xw,0.0508xh&resize=360:*", "https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/gettyimages-927345946-1525272447.jpg?crop=1.00xw:0.341xh;0,0.0812xh&resize=640:*", "https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/millie-bobby-brown-jake-bongiovi-gettyimages-1673812984-652d89c52f4e5.jpg?crop=1.00xw:0.668xh;0,0.0513xh&resize=360:*", "http://www.elle.com/_assets/design-tokens/elle/static/images/logos/network-logo.242fea1.svg?primary=%2523ffffff", "https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/gettyimages-927345946-1525272447.jpg?crop=1.00xw:0.342xh;0,0.0797xh&resize=1200:*", "http://www.elle.com/_assets/design-tokens/elle/static/images/logos/logo.2856426.svg?primary=navLogoColor"], "top_img": "https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/gettyimages-927345946-1525272447.jpg?crop=1.00xw:0.342xh;0,0.0797xh&resize=1200:*", "keywords": [], "authors": [], "canonical_link": "https://www.elle.com/culture/celebrities/a20122925/miley-cyrus-on-living-with-liam-hemsworth-pranks/", "title": "Miley Cyrus Really Opened Up About Living With Liam Hemsworth", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "X-UA-Compatible": "IE=edge,chrom=1", "msapplication-tap-highlight": "no", "title": "Miley Cyrus on Living With Liam Hemsworth and His Pranks -

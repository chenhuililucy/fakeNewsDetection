{"url": "www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-4961318/Angelina-Jolie-s-honeytrap-plot-seize-Kony.html", "text": "Joseph Kony is a Ugandan warlord and leader of The Lord\u2019s Resistance Army, a cultish militant group that operates in central Africa. He has more than 60 wives and his alleged crimes include murder, kidnapping, rape and military enslavement of more than 30,000 children.\n\nIn 2005, he was indicted by the International Criminal Court for war crimes and crimes against humanity, but despite endless efforts by skilled military personnel, he has evaded capture and remains one of Africa\u2019s most dangerous and wanted men.\n\nSo it came as a bit of a shock this weekend when we learned \u2014 thanks to documents leaked from within the ICC \u2014 that in 2012, Angelina Jolie, Oscar-winning film star, mother of many, thrice-married international humanitarian, United Nations special envoy and all-round sex bomb, had offered to come to the ICC\u2019s rescue. Apparently, she had generously offered to hunt Kony down herself.\n\nKony has more than 60 wives and his alleged crimes include murder, kidnapping, rape and military enslavement of more than 30,000 children\n\nEven more surprising, was that Luis Moreno Ocampo, the dashing Argentine ICC chief prosecutor cited at the time as one of the \u2018100 Top Global Thinkers\u2019, not only accepted Angie\u2019s generous offer, but actually pinned his hopes on her succeeding where the ICC, with its \u00a3130 million-a-year budget and machine-gun toting Special Forces, had failed.\n\nThe plan was simple, though sadly for all Lara Croft: Tomb Raider enthusiasts, it involved no skin-tight Lycra, no bosoms jutting like torpedoes or automatic weapons strapped to Angie\u2019s gleaming thighs. In fact, there were to be no guns at all.\n\nInstead, Angie would be embedded with U.S. Special Forces close to Kony\u2019s stronghold in northern Uganda and act as a honeytrap. And, as one leaked email sent by Moreno Ocampo explains, once settled in, she \u2018has the idea to invite Kony to dinner and then arrest him\u2019.\n\n\u2018Forget other celebrities, she is the one,\u2019 Moreno Ocampo wrote excitedly in another email. \u2018She loves to arrest Kony. She is ready. Probably Brad [Pitt, her third husband] will go also.\u2019\n\nThe emails were found in 40,000 files obtained by the French investigative website Mediapart and shared with The Sunday Times\u2019 Insight team. Not surprisingly, they have caused quite a stir.\n\nAngie may be the world\u2019s sexiest woman, but was it likely that, after eluding hundreds of highly trained military personnel, a war criminal and alleged mass murderer would let his guard down just for the chance of a dinner date?\n\nThen again, men do have a habit of becoming a bit hot and bothered when face to face with Jolie\u2019s pillowy lips, slender figure, entrancing d\u00e9colletage and raging social conscience.\n\nThe leader of The Lords Resistance Army was indicted for war crimes including the military enslavement of children\n\nWhen she first appeared at the Davos World Economic Forum in 2005, macroeconomics flew out of the window. Finance ministers apparently became pink and flustered and lost their train of thought. Media moguls were distracted and dreamy.\n\nOne senior executive said at the time: \u2018No one could concentrate. She has an extraordinary effect...\u2019\n\nFormer Foreign Secretary William Hague was famously entranced by Angie\u2019s good works when they met at a film screening in 2011. The pair struck up an immediate friendship and have since worked on a joint mission to end war rape across the world. In 2015, he admitted he was stepping down at the election so he could continue his quest with Angie.\n\nIt goes without saying that beetle-browed Moreno Ocampo \u2014 a legal heavyweight and anti-corruption expert who had gained fame as assistant prosecutor in the infamous Trial of the Juntas \u2014 had a huge crush on Angie.\n\nIt began in 2009 when the actress attended the trial of Congo warlord Thomas Lubanga (his conviction for forcibly recruiting child soldiers was Moreno Ocampo\u2019s sole successful prosecution in nine years as ICC chief prosecutor).\n\nAngelina Jolie offered to come to the International Criminal Court\u2019s rescue by hunting down Kony herself\n\nPleased as punch \u2014 the Argentine liked nothing more than the presence of a celebrity to add fairy dust to his daily grind \u2014 in 2010 he wrote to Jolie, via her assistant, asking her to become his advisor.\n\n\u2018I see a role for her helping us to understand and build bridges with the humanitarian campus and with citizens concerned from all over the world,\u2019 he said.\n\nNothing came of it. Perhaps Jolie was too busy that year starring in The Tourist with Johnny Depp, establishing the Shiloh Jolie-Pitt Foundation to support conservation work in the Kalahari, opening a school in Afghanistan, or looking after her ever-expanding family.\n\nWho knows? But then in 2011, deep joy, she popped up again. She\u2019d written and produced a film about the Bosnian War, In The Land Of Blood And Honey, and wanted to know if he liked it.\n\nLiked it?! He loved it, and despite supposedly having one of the most demanding jobs in international humanitarian law and being in demand as a consultant to the World Bank and UN, found time to watch it over (and over) again.\n\nUnlike some reviewers who considered the dialogue clunky and awkward, or one critic who called it a \u2018messy, unnatural war porno\u2019, he was utterly entranced and gushed in an email to her about how he felt it \u2018was comparable to Shakespeare\u2019 with a plot \u2018so strong I am still recovering\u2019.\n\nFormer Foreign Secretary William Hague was famously entranced by Angie\u2019s good works when they met at a film screening in 2011 and has fought to stop rape being used as a weapon with the star\n\nSeveral days later, having watched it again, he was back in touch, love-bombing her with praise: \u2018I am in LA and watched the movie again (4th time)... you are a genius. You did exactly what you said: a love story showing the war horrors. Xx Luis.\u2019\n\nAngie was thrilled.\n\n\u2018Louis, I wish you could see the smile on my face. You represent with your work all that I value. I\u2019m so happy the film speaks to you.\u2019\n\nWho cared if she\u2019d spelled his name wrongly? Luis certainly did not.\n\nBeneath his carefully trimmed beard, he was so chuffed that he instantly starting planning an important new humanitarian starring role for Ms Jolie: helping bring the evil Joseph Kony to trial.\n\nAngie was immediately on board, going public in a 2012 video calling for Kony\u2019s arrest. \u2018He\u2019s an extraordinarily horrible human being who, you know... his time has come and it\u2019s lovely to see young people are raising up as well,\u2019 she said.\n\nAnd then, apparently, she came up with her cunning honeytrap idea to lure Kony to a dinner in the Central African Republic so he could be arrested.\n\nIt was dangerous work. Kony is the sort of man who cuts off people\u2019s lips and noses and forces children to kill their parents and siblings with machetes.\n\nEven by Jolie\u2019s standards \u2014 she is the sort of woman who used to wear a vial of her second husband\u2019s blood in a necklace and has never shied from doing the unexpected \u2014 the plan seemed deeply unadvisable.\n\nBut Moreno Ocampo was thrilled. He liaised with anti-Kony pressure group Invisible Children and the Special Forces trying to trap Kony, and reported back: \u2018You can be embedded with the Special Forces chasing Kony. Can Brad go with you?\n\n\u2018It will be great to spend more time with the American troops,\u2019 he wrote. \u2018They are eager to get Kony, but after meeting you, they will do it.\u2019\n\nAngelina Jolie was prepared to lure Joseph Kony, a man who eluded hundreds of highly trained military personnel, to dinner\n\nPerhaps he meant she would inspire them to succeed where everyone before had failed. Perhaps he felt she really would be able to lure Kony into a trap.\n\nWhatever, it seemed to be all systems go. \u2018Brad is being supportive,\u2019 replied Ang. \u2018Let\u2019s discuss logistics. Much love Xxx.\u2019\n\nAnd then? Nothing. Angie went quiet. Maybe the trip went ahead, but more likely not \u2014 there is no further mention in the leaked files and Kony is still at large.\n\nUndaunted however, Moreno Ocampo was back emailing Angie the following month. This time, he was asking for advice.\n\nAfter a sensitive three-year enquiry, he had decided the ICC couldn\u2019t investigate war crimes in the Palestinian territories, but did not know how best to announce his decision. \u2018The issue is how to present it to the normal people...\u2019 he emailed her. \u2018So if you have any ideas, just let me know.\n\n\u2018I am attaching the decision I will take. It is confidential. Please don\u2019t share it before Tuesday.\u2019\n\nAngie\u2019s response? \u2018I suggest read your statement but consider not opening the floor to questions.\u2019\n\nSadly, for Moreno Ocampo, this was to be Angie\u2019s last email. She was edging away from his increasingly enthusiastic contact. He couldn\u2019t even tempt her back with proposals for a charity education project... though he kept trying.\n\n\u2018Dear Angie, I hope you are well. I miss you.\u2019 No answer.\n\nAngie wasn\u2019t the only Hollywood star Ocampo tried \u2014 and failed \u2014 to recruit. But he made even less headway with actors George Clooney and Sean Penn.\n\nClooney refused his request for help flying spy satellites over Libya \u2018to put pressure on Gaddafi\u2019s generals\u2019. And when Ocampo invited Penn to a New York hotel to discuss a potential investigation into the Palestinian conflict, he received a flip response.\n\n\u2018While you make the decision on Palestine, I\u2019m embroiled in a decision weather [sic] or not to get a steam in the hotel spa,\u2019 wrote Penn.\n\nMeanwhile, he still wasn\u2019t ready to give up, and when he read reports that Angie was unwell, emailed her assistant in a panic, saying: \u2018I realise how much I love her.\u2019 And finally, an answer. From the assistant, though \u2014 mortifyingly curt and notifying him that Angie had changed her private email address.\n\nAnd that was that. Shortly afterwards, his ICC tenure came to an end and he left to pursue other avenues in law, human rights and international conflict. Oh yes, and last year, reportedly approached glamorous humanitarian lawyer Amal Clooney (George\u2019s wife) for help with a case.\n\nMeanwhile, Angie has continued with her tireless humanitarian work.\n\nAnd, tragically, evil Kony remains at large, unlikely now ever to accept a dinner invitation to Angeline Jolie, however tempted he might be.", "images":

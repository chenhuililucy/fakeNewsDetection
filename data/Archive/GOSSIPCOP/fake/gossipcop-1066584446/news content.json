{"url": "www.dailymail.co.uk/femail/article-5032503/White-Witch-warns-Angelina-Jolie-against-using-spells.html", "text": "A white witch from North London has urged Hollywood star Angelina Jolie to cease dabbling in magic to try to woo back ex-husband Brad Pitt.\n\nBack in September, Star magazine reported that Angelina was 'turning to bizarre spiritual rituals in an effort to fix her life and get Brad back', but Carrie Kirkpatrick, 51, says she knew that what the actress was doing was very wrong.\n\n'When you use spells to try and win someone back, you have to be very careful what you wish for,' Carrie told FEMAIL. 'Brad and Angelina split up for a reason, so if she succeeds in getting back with him, she may end up unhappy.\n\n'She is making a foolish mistake if she thinks she can manipulate him back into her life using magic. He has free will. If they are meant to be together, then love and their highest selves will find a way.'\n\nCarrie, who is ordained as a Priestess Of the Goddess and teaches people how to connect with the 'mystical goddess energies', also noted how Angelina and Brad had a mutual tattooing session last year, months before their union ended,\n\nIt was a symbolic effort to 'bind their marriage', but it failed because she was 'forcing' them to stay together, she said.\n\nWhite witch Carrie Kirkpatrick, 51, from London has cautioned Angelina Jolie not to try to manipulate Brad Pitt into coming back to her through the power of magic\n\nReports suggest that that Angelina has been 'turning to bizarre spiritual rituals in an effort to fix her life and get Brad back' following her split from Brad last year\n\nThe actress flew her tattooist to Cambodia to do a new inking that would spiritually bind her marriage to Brad, but months later they split up\n\nCarrie says Angelina has always been interested in the 'dark arts'.\n\n'The way she used to wear her ex-husband Billy Bob Thornton's blood in a vial around her neck, this is a form of blood magic,' she explained.\n\n'It feeds into her tendencies towards BDSM. For her, obsession and possession equal love.'\n\n'Angelina is known to have a strong interest in the occult, especially Voodoo and Hoodoo.\n\nHATHOR\u2019S MIRROR: A LOVE SPELL FOR HALLOWEEN Carrie has shared a spell for those looking for love at Halloween, but advises that anyone who uses it must have pure intentions. Trying to control someone else\u2019s will, as she believes Angelina is doing with her magic, won\u2019t work. 'When a person works magic to \"keep\" or \"get\" a particular love interest, it may work, but only for a short period of time,' she said. Tools: Pink/red candle, candlestick, rose/jasmine oil, handheld mirror. Egyptian/inspiring music. Jasmine incense Light the incense, turn down the lights and play the music softly. Anoint the candle with rose or jasmine oil and, focusing on the candle, call upon the Goddess, saying: 'Great Goddess Hathor, Goddess of Love, of Beauty and Joy, I ask that you be here present this night, that I may voice my true desire for a lover in my life who will lift my heart with passionate joy. May they be guided to my side that we may share a love so true. May our hearts sing with joy in honour of you. Guide me to be in the right place at the right time to meet my heart\u2019s desire, and that they be ready and willing to love me with a passion equal to mine. Show me my new love, O Goddess divine.' Now light the candle and place it in the candlestick on a table and say: 'So mote it be!' Then take the handheld mirror and gaze into it. Allow your eyes to lose their focus and, as you look at your reflection, see if another face appears before you. Who is it? Is it someone you already know? Perhaps you will see yourself in a particular situation, look at where you are, taking note of the details. How do you appear? Who else is there? This may be where you meet your lover. When you feel ready, re-focus your eyes and bring your awareness back into the room. Thank Hathor for gifting you the vision and say: 'Hail and farewell.' Then let the candle burn all the way down.

It's to protect the practitioner as well as the subjects of their magic,' said Carrie.\n\nAngelina is also a devotee of tattoos and before she split from Brad, the couple were inked alongside one another by ex Thai monk Ajarn Noo Kanpai, who they flew to Siem Reap in Cambodia in February 2016 to work on the symbolic designs.\n\nShe acquired three new mystical sak yant back inkings from the Thai artist, a style which encompasses lines of script, geometric patterns and animal shapes, while Brad had the left side of his stomach tattooed with a Buddhist symbol.\n\nThe process was meant to 'symbolically bind them as husband and wife', but they ended up splitting in September 2016.\n\nCarrie said: 'This is a classic case of the magic rebounding, as she was trying to force them to stay together.\n\n'She uses her tattoos as protective talismans but they are not linked to witchcraft.\n\n'They're magical though, in that she associates them with protective qualities. So she is using the magic of the Far East. This is not witchcraft as we on the West know it - it's the \"magic\" of another culture.'\n\nThe star also reportedly used magic to woo her man, by presenting him with a vial of grey powder that turned out to be a cremated bat, purportedly to ward off negative energies and accidents.\n\n'It's more likely that this was intended to bind him to her,' Carried explained.\n\n'She comes across as a bit insecure so she may have felt that she needed the magic to seal the deal and prevent any other witches or occultists from attacking her or sabotaging her love life.\n\nIt's all about the sex with Angelina, and by that I mean the power she can exert over a man. This is like an elixir, the ultimate possession.\n\n'She clearly wanted Brad very much and would not consider letting him go. But ultimately, this is a fool's game as there's no point in trying to make someone be with you.\n\nCARRIE'S LIFE AS A WITCH Seeing Carrie doing the weekly shop with her 11-year-old son, you'd be forgiven for thinking she's just like all the other mums. But she isn't the same at all \u2013 not by a long stretch. As a lonely, only child, Carrie always felt 'different'. She remembers being able to read people's minds but she'd get scolded for it. 'I knew I had special talents but I pushed them away,' she recalled. 'I didn't want people to think I was a weirdo! So I just kept quiet and decided a life as a psychic wasn't for me.' Growing up, Carrie always felt different and could read people's thoughts but she kept her abilities hidden for fear of being judged Fate, though, seemed to have other ideas. As the young Carrie grew up, she tried to ignore that part of herself and it wasn't until she was an adult that she found herself drawn back towards the world of the supernatural. 'I realised it always destined to be part of my life. So I started doing readings for people, never thinking it would take off. The white witch specialises in helping the lovelorn 'But it did and, amazingly, I've been working as a professional psychic clairvoyant now for over 30 years.' Every morning at home, Carrie makes a point of grounding herself and giving thanks to the Goddesses for all that she has. 'I am lucky to live surrounded by woods and I have four cats. It's really important to connect with the cycle of nature and acknowledge the season. This is what magic is all about.' She also performs daily cleansing rituals, using sage and essential oils. 'A lot of people visit my house,' she says, 'so it's important that I clear away all the energies that belong to others.'

Why would anyone want to be with someone who doesn't want to be with them?'\n\nAssisting the lovelorn is one of Carrie's many talents. 'I've helped all kinds of people using magic,' she says. 'People with legal issues, love troubles, fears and insecurities.\n\n'I guide them through transformation in their lives, by showing them how to face their fears and follow their true path.'\n\nCarrie cautions again using love spells on anyone who you are certain doesn't want to be in your life\n\nWhen working with people who've come to her, Carrie has found that some are \u2013 or have been \u2013 witches.\n\n'I believe that many people are born witches, and that they have been witches, healers and psychics in previous lives. These people often bring with them a fear of persecution due to the history of so many witches being executed,' she claims.\n\n'When working with them, it's important for me to help them heal past life trauma so that they can be themselves in this life and do the work that they're destined to do.", "images": ["https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2023/10/16/01/76597179-0-image-a-172_1697415246953.jpg",

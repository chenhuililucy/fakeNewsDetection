Which, to be clear, is definitely not anyone's business, and is also pretty sexist!\n\nThat aside, a pap caught up with Justin while he was buying coffee, and made the mistake of asking him about the rumors, saying \"Is Hailey pregnant right now? You stated that you guys are family, so everybody was thinking she might be pregnant.\"\n\nMore From Cosmopolitan\n\nJustin's response? To stop in his tracks and call this dude out, saying \"What\u2019s your deal, bro? You just seem too like, you just seem too normal to be doing this job... I just don\u2019t understand why you gotta try to get a rise, you know what I\u2019m saying?\" He also said \"No, you know what you\u2019re doing\" when the pap tried to defend himself, and eventually asked for the camera to be turned off.\n\nHonestly, Justin handled himself pretty well in the face of a highly inappropriate and boundary-crossing question. Agree?\n\nThis content is imported from poll.

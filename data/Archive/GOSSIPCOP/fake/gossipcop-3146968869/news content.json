But, it turns out, Couric never wanted the job back.\n\n\"I did that for 15 years, and I really loved every minute of it, but you also have to pass the baton,\" Couric tells CountryLiving.com at the launch of Sally Kohn's The Opposite of Hate.\n\nGetty Images\n\n\n\n\n\nNBC named Hoda Kotb as Lauer's official replacement in January, making Kotb and host Savannah Guthrie the first female-duo of the morning news program.\n\nMore From Country Living\n\n\"They\u2019re doing a great job,\" Couric says of the pairing. \"I think Hoda and Savannah are a great team. It\u2019s wonderful to see two smart, strong women working together.\"\n\n\n\nNBC\n\nWith no plans to return to Today, Couric says she is currently focusing on her new show called America Inside Out, which premieres Wednesday on the National Geographic Channel.\n\n\"I really have been focusing on these deep dives,\" Couric shares. \"I admire the work everyone has been doing, but this has been a really gratifying experience for me, because you still need to get into the interior of the country to talk to real Americans about what\u2019s happening, and you can\u2019t always do that in a studio with a lot of experts.\"\n\n\n\nThe six-part series follows Couric as she travels all over the U.S. and reports on issues that she believes are not being covered by major news programs.\n\n\"I really just spent time traveling around the country talking about issues that I believe are getting [lost] in the mainstream media,\" she says. \"I think with this administration there\u2019s so much to cover, but the news cycle is so insane that I\u2019m afraid these big issues are not being talked about.\"", "images":

The matriarch of the Kardiashan Jenner family is on the hunt for a new personal assistant. She explains what she\u2019s looking for,\n\nIt\u2019s about being discreet and being private and learning. That\u2019s definitely a skill set. And being able to be mature and understand what the family is all about. If somebody has something that\u2019s happening in your life at the moment and it is a private thing, then somebody [would need] to have a lot of respect for that.\n\nThe business woman who is the brains behind her family\u2019s reality show, Keeping Up With the Kardashians, says that has no tolerance for,\n\nWhen something needs to be protected and somebody else doesn\u2019t understand the importance of that. That\u2019s a problem.\n\nKris also makes it clear that she\u2019ll take legal action against an employee that does something wrong and will hold them accountable.\n\nWe obviously will go to and spare [raises voice] no expense to hold somebody accountable if that happens on our team. I don\u2019t care how much money somebody might have, if they have nothing. Some people think, \u2018Oh, I don\u2019t have any money, and they\u2019re not going to sue me.\u2019\n\nShe laughed,\n\nWell, we\u2019ll take payments. We\u2019ll garner those wages for, you know, the next 10 years. But I just think that people don\u2019t think. It\u2019s a foolish thing to do. Some people think, \u2018Oh, I don\u2019t have any money, and they\u2019re not going to sue me.\u2019 Well, we\u2019ll take payments.\n\nIn terms of what Kris is looking for, she needs someone on call 24 hours a day and have\n\nscheduling down on a very high level. It\u2019s nonstop. Every day is different, you never know what to expect and you have to be ready to pivot on a dime.\n\nFollow us: @theJasmineBRAND on Twitter | theJasmineBRAND on Facebook| theJasmineBRAND_ on Instagram", "images": ["https://thejasminebrand.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Kanye-West-signs-partnership-with-Gap-thejasminebrand-50x50.png", "https://thejasminebrand.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Untitled-design-140x120.png", "https://thejasminebrand.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Black-Rob-thejasminebrand-534x350.png", "https://thejasminebrand.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/DSC_8527-590x350.jpg", "https://thejasminebrand.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/Screen-Shot-2017-09-06-at-1.51.53-PM.png", "https://thejasminebrand.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/header_logo.png", "http://pixel.quantserve.com/pixel/p-fW0pAAr8h2cQp.gif", "https://thejasminebrand.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/Khloe-Kardashian-Kourtney-Kardashian-Kim-Kardashian-Kris-Jenner-Kylie-Jenner-Cosmo-Party-the-jasmine-brand.jpg", "https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/5c2e04c609b4286eda02f9962cff0204?s=60&d=mm&r=x", "https://thejasminebrand.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/mobile_logo-150x14.png", "https://thejasminebrand.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/header_logo.png", "https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/eda6b8108e0add261c460777f0e86823?s=50&d=mm&r=x", "https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/1655c7e9bde3540ab6bb443c8370b408?s=50&d=mm&r=x", "https://thejasminebrand.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/Screen-shot-2012-11-30-at-5.13.27-PM-238x91.png", "https://thejasminebrand.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/jada-pinkett-smith-will-smith-the-jasmine-brand-50x50.jpg", "https://thejasminebrand.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/Screen-Shot-2018-02-10-at-1.34.21-PM.png", "https://thejasminebrand.com/wp-content/themes/wpex-spartan/images/prev-post.png", "https://thejasminebrand.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/11/438135353-50x50.jpg", "https://thejasminebrand.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/iggy-azalea-quits-twitter-the-jasmine-brand.jpg", "https://certify.alexametrics.com/atrk.gif?account=ft0is1DTcA20Ug", "https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/3abd87d8a025aa49bd93b9cba8542db0?s=50&d=mm&r=x", "https://thejasminebrand.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/Screen-Shot-2014-01-13-at-8.02.41-AM.png", "https://thejasminebrand.com/wp-content/themes/tjb_theme/images/noimage.jpg", "https://thejasminebrand.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/SINGLE-IMAGE-w-INSERT-9-50x50.png", "https://thejasminebrand.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Keke-Wyatt-Zackariah-David-thejasminebrand-510x350.png", "https://thejasminebrand.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/Elise-Neal-Hollywood-Divas-the-jasmine-brand-620x351.png", "https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/0170acacdd8d912881ccaebafa06a14b?s=50&d=mm&r=x", "https://thejasminebrand.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/soulja-boy-ariana-grande-michael-jackson-the-jasmine-brand.jpg", "https://thejasminebrand.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/jada-pinkett-smith-bikini-thanksgiving-a-the-jasmine-brand-238x91.jpg", "https://thejasminebrand.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Screen-Shot-2019-07-23-at-10.40.02-AM-50x50.png", "https://thejasminebrand.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/lil-kim-mr-papers-expecting-baby-boy-the-jasmine-brand-50x50.jpg", "https://thejasminebrand.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/dwyane-wade-ex-wife-the-jasmine-brand.jpg", "https://thejasminebrand.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/Kris-Jenner-Attends-Cosmopolitan-50th-Birthday-Celebration-the-jasmine-brand.jpg", "https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/7588c70f497001d9cc077199b548929e?s=50&d=mm&r=x", "https://thejasminebrand.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Screen-Shot-2023-10-16-at-3.31.49-PM-50x50.png", "https://thejasminebrand.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/FD43B020-04DD-4072-A37F-215E8F7BB6AE-620x350.jpeg", "http://b.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6035233&cv=2.0&cj=1", "https://thejasminebrand.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/Screen-Shot-2018-06-11-at-1.08.47-PM.png", "https://thejasminebrand.com/wp-content/themes/wpex-spartan/images/next-post.png", "https://thejasminebrand.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/JB-15-140x120.png"], "top_img": "https://thejasminebrand.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/Kris-Jenner-Attends-Cosmopolitan-50th-Birthday-Celebration-the-jasmine-brand.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Tjb Writer"], "canonical_link": "https://thejasminebrand.com/2018/05/17/kris-jenner-is-not-afraid-to-sue-an-employee-even-if-if-theyre-poor-well-take-payments-garner-your-wages/", "title": "Kris Jenner Is Not Afraid To Sue An Employee, Even If If They're Poor", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "robots": "index, follow, max-image-preview:large, max-snippet:-1, max-video-preview:-1", "description": "Kris Jenner Is Not Afraid To Sue An Employee, Even If If They're Poor - We'll Take Payments & Garner Your Wages!

The former Victoria's Secret angel told Harper's Bazaar of her move into motherhood, 'Everything feels so special and sweet and wholesome and loving and then at the same time it's been... life-changing, and my focus is now this person; this is what I want to do.\n\n'This is what I want to pour my heart into now.'\n\nWell that may well be the most adorable thing we hear today.\n\nRelated Story Why Everyone Needs To Buy A Beige Blazer Now\n\nRelated Story Rosie Huntington-Whiteley Wears Zara Bodysuit", "images":

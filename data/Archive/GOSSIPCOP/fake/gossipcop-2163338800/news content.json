Holmes, 38, and Foxx, 50, looked very happy together - and just look at the way the actress is gazing at her boyfriend.\n\nTakes us right back to the royal wedding...\n\nHolmes also helped the actor celebrated his recent 50th, and the duo were seen arriving together at Paramount Pictures for his party.\n\n\n\nGetty Images\n\nSpeaking previously about keeping his relationships out of the spotlight, he told ET: 'I like to stay quiet, you know, with anyone that dating; that I'm really, really dating.\n\n'I feel like this... if there's somebody that you're dating, the worst thing you can do is let that [points at camera] touch you. Because once that camera touches you, [it's out]. ... Yeah, we don't take time to do that [make sure the relationship is real] in Hollywood anymore.'", "images":

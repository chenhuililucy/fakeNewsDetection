On an episode of the WTF With Marc Maron podcast, she said they aren't really friends anymore.\n\n\u201c[We\u2019re] probably not as friendly as we could be, no,\u201d she said. \u201cThere are too many aspects of it that just prevented us from ever moving forward [from the] past. We dated from when I was, like, 18, 19 until 25ish.\u201d\n\nThis content is imported from poll. You may be able to find the same content in another format, or you may be able to find more information, at their web site.\n\nLast week, during an episode of Dax Shepherd's podcast, she implied that her breakup with Macaulay was mostly her fault.\n\nMore From Cosmopolitan\n\nEthan Miller // Getty Images\n\n\u201cAnd it\u2019s f*cked up what I did,\" she said. \"It\u2019s f*cked up what I did and it\u2019s f*cked up how I did it. When I got to be single I said, \u2018I just need to figure myself out.\u2019 I genuinely need to know why I did what I did, and, like, regroup myself as a human being.\u201d\n\nShe didn't say exactly what happened, but she did say that she was a \"d*ck\" during their breakup, which could explain why they're no longer friends. Although, she also said their friends have forgiven her for what happened (whatever that is).\n\n\u201cYou know, it\u2019s been so long like I feel like enough time has gone by,\u201d Mila said. \u201cI think enough mutual friends have been like, everybody kind of forgave everybody for what went down.\u201d\n\n\n\nSince their split, they've both started seeing (and marrying) other people. Mila and Ashton Kutcher have been married since 2015 and Macaulay is currently dating Brenda Song.\n\nFollow Emma on Instagram.", "images": ["https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/screen-shot-2023-10-16-at-10-48-02-am-652d4d3a5601d.png?crop=0.471xw:0.853xh;0.0160xw,0.0347xh&resize=360:*", "https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/screen-shot-2023-10-17-at-7-58-15-am-652e772c2bc3d.png?crop=0.913xw:1.00xh;0,0&resize=360:*", "https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/stephen-curry-and-ayesha-curry-attend-the-2022-sports-news-photo-1697468140.jpg?crop=0.587xw:0.392xh;0.189xw,0.0715xh&resize=360:*", "https://hips.hearstapps.com/vidthumb/images/screen-shot-2022-02-03-at-3-13-42-pm-1643919322.jpg?crop=0.9962319639738993xw:1xh;center,top&resize=480:*", "http://www.cosmopolitan.com/_assets/design-tokens/fre/static/icons/social/pinterest.e8cf655.svg?primary=%2523ffffff", "https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/selena-gomez-gettyimages-1699488086-652d70db4a057.jpg?crop=0.668xw:1.00xh;0.160xw,0&resize=360:*", "https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/untitled-design-2023-07-27t110740-576-64c28ac67daa9.png?crop=0.489xw:0.978xh;0.511xw,0.0128xh&resize=360:*", "https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/gettyimages-1723109765-652ae4885464e.jpg?crop=1.00xw:0.669xh;0,0.0652xh&resize=360:*", "http://www.cosmopolitan.com/_assets/design-tokens/cosmopolitan/static/images/logos/logo.3c052be.svg?primary=%2523ffffff", "https://hips.hearstapps.com/rover/profile_photos/b2b38a31-b37e-4724-be4b-7c06d87ae69e_1675780182.file?fill=1:1&resize=120:*", "https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/actor-macaulay-culkin-and-actress-mila-kunis-attend-the-news-photo-55932271-1533126484.jpg?crop=1xw:1xh;center,top&resize=980:*", "http://www.cosmopolitan.com/_assets/design-tokens/fre/static/icons/social/instagram.f282b14.svg?primary=currentColor&id=link-out-embed", "https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/screenshot-2023-09-22-at-3-01-04-pm-650de488ccfaf.png?crop=0.473xw:1.00xh;0.527xw,0&resize=360:*", "https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/screen-shot-2023-10-17-at-6-59-30-am-652e69225bfbc.png?crop=0.529xw:1.00xh;0.216xw,0&resize=360:*", "https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/taylor-swift-and-travis-kelce-have-dinner-at-waverly-inn-on-news-photo-1697543078.jpg?crop=1.00xw:0.815xh;0,0&resize=360:*", "https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/screen-shot-2023-07-20-at-9-58-50-am-64b959e11fc5f.png?crop=0.452xw:0.896xh;0.548xw,0&resize=360:*", "http://www.cosmopolitan.com/_assets/design-tokens/fre/static/icons/social/youtube.ce3e1ae.svg?primary=%2523DA8EEA&id=social-button-icon", "http://www.cosmopolitan.com/_assets/design-tokens/fre/static/icons/social/instagram.f282b14.svg?primary=%2523DA8EEA&id=social-button-icon", "https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/priyanka-chopra-jonas-and-nick-jonas-pose-backstage-at-the-news-photo-1697387669.jpg?crop=0.934xw:0.706xh;0.0208xw,0.0508xh&resize=360:*", "http://www.cosmopolitan.com/_assets/design-tokens/cosmopolitan/static/images/logos/network-logo.722abed.svg?primary=%2523ffffff", "https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/gettyimages-1388057696-652c143e55acd.jpg?crop=1.00xw:0.668xh;0,0.0554xh&resize=360:*", "http://www.cosmopolitan.com/_assets/design-tokens/fre/static/icons/social/pinterest.e8cf655.svg?primary=%2523DA8EEA&id=social-button-icon", "http://www.cosmopolitan.com/_assets/design-tokens/fre/static/icons/social/facebook.a5a3a69.svg?primary=%2523DA8EEA&id=social-button-icon", "https://hips.hearstapps.com/rover/profile_photos/b2b38a31-b37e-4724-be4b-7c06d87ae69e_1675780182.file?fill=1:1&resize=160:*", "http://www.cosmopolitan.com/_assets/design-tokens/fre/static/icons/social/twitter.c44156b.svg?primary=%2523DA8EEA&id=social-button-icon", "https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/macaulay-culkin-and-mila-kunis-exclusive-news-photo-83386408-1533126287.jpg?crop=1xw:0.589xh;center,top&resize=1200:*", "https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/macaulay-culkin-and-mila-kunis-exclusive-news-photo-83386408-1533126287.jpg?resize=640:*"], "top_img": "https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/macaulay-culkin-and-mila-kunis-exclusive-news-photo-83386408-1533126287.jpg?crop=1xw:0.589xh;center,top&resize=1200:*", "keywords": [], "authors": [], "canonical_link": "https://www.cosmopolitan.com/entertainment/celebs/a22612730/mila-kunis-macaulay-culkin-arent-friendly/", "title": "Mila Kunis Says She and Ex Macaulay Culkin Aren't as \"Friendly\" as They Could Be", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "X-UA-Compatible": "IE=edge,chrom=1", "msapplication-tap-highlight": "no", "title": "Mila Kunis Says She and Ex Macaulay Culkin Aren't Friends -

Australia (via the Daily Mail), the young pair have parted ways due to their inability to agree about when to start a family.\n\nAn insider apparently told the magazine that 28 year-old Hemsworth wished to have children, whilst 25 year-old Cyrus was not ready, \u2018He wants kids and doesn't want to keep putting it off but it's not quite the timeline Miley had in mind.\u2019\n\nGetty Images\n\n\n\n\n\nThe source claimed the Hannah Montana star was hesitant to tie the knot at all, \u2018Miley put off plans for the wedding and Liam was growing tired of it... They haven't been getting along in recent months.\u2019\n\nThe insider added, \u2018[She] didn't really want to get married. It's something that everyone else seemed to get but Liam. [His] family had been begging him to see the light for a long time, but he had faith in Miley. Now he feels like an idiot.\u2019\n\nThis news comes days after the \u2018Wrecking Ball\u2019 singer deleted all posts on her Instagram.\n\nHemsworth, however, still has all his posts, including those which feature the singer-actress.\n\nInstagram\n\nThe Hunger Games star met Cyrus on the set of the 2009 film The Last Song and they subsequently began dating. First engaged in 2012, the pair tragically broke it off just the following year. After an almost four year hiatus, the pair recoupled in 2016.\n\nIn September of last year, however, Cyrus told the Sun that she had no plans to marry any time soon, explaining, \u2018I don't envision marriage. I'm 24. I hope I get to live a little bit more, I have too much living to do [before I get married].'\n\nShe continued, 'Three years ago, if you\u2019d asked me if I\u2019d be here, this happy with this man, I\u2019d have been stunned. I\u2019m just riding this out. In some relationships, you lose yourself by being with someone else. Actually, it made me find myself more. I have no idea what the next three years will bring, but if it\u2019s possible to get even happier, I\u2019ll take it.\u2019\n\nGetty Images\n\nDespite these statements, rumours of a secret marriage swirled. Though, it appears they were just that, rumours.\n\nWell this is just terrible news isn't it?\n\nRelated Story Liam Pranks Miley Cyrus On Instagram Again\n\nRelated Story Watch Liam Hemsworth Terrify

One of them is the report that they snubbed the power couple Kim Kardashian and Kanye West.\n\nThe report said that Kardashian feels that Middleton and Prince William are snubbing or disinterested in meeting her and her husband. The royal couple allegedly turned down the invitation to attend West's concert a couple of times. The \"Keeping up with the Kardashians\" star feels that it is snobbery towards her.\n\nThe mother of two was not in good terms with Beyonce. She knew that the royal couple met with her during a Nets game with her husband Jay Z. Kardashian feels that Beyonce has an edge over her. Kim Kardashian was allegedly hurt especially that Middleton is her idol.\n\nGossip Cop debunked the above-mentioned report as fake news because it was not from a reliable source. Knowing the Duke and the Duchess of Cambridge are busy people, missing an invitation is unlikely but if not done beforehand, the possibility is that it cannot be accommodated into their schedules.\n\nThe Siver Times reiterated a report that the royal couple saw Kim Kardashian and her husband as a has-been. In 2015, a report has mentioned that Kim and her husband has been inviting the royal couple but were turned down again and again.\n\nKim sent Princess Charlotte a custom-made dress from Kanye's clothing line but it was returned. One time, when Kim heard that Middleton was coming to the White House, she reportedly asked then First Lady Michelle Obama to have them met. But the First Lady declined.\n\nWhether Kate Middleton does not want a friendship with Kim Kardashian and Kanye West is not known but the Duchess snubbing them for no reason is not true as debunked by Gossip Cop.", "images": ["https://assetsorigin.travelerstoday.com/static/common/_v1.2.0/images/bell.svg", "http://in.getclicky.com/66581481ns.gif", "https://assetsorigin.travelerstoday.com/static/common/_v1.2.0/images/travelers-today-logo-header.svg", "https://assetsorigin.travelerstoday.com/static/common/_v1.2.0/images/burger-menu.svg", "https://assetsorigin.travelerstoday.com/static/common/_v1.2.0/images/travelers-today-logo-footer.svg", "http://static.getclicky.com/media/links/badge.gif", "https://data.travelerstoday.com/data/thumbs/full/54622/110/110/50/40/brown-and-black-vehicle-parked-near-trees.jpg", "https://data.travelerstoday.com/data/thumbs/full/54623/110/110/50/40/white-cruise-ship-sailing-on-sea.jpg", "https://ssl-scienceworldreport-com-4a4da2.c-col.com", "https://assetsorigin.travelerstoday.com/static/common/_v1.2.0/images/facebook-logo.svg", "https://data.travelerstoday.com/data/thumbs/full/54616/110/110/50/40/cashier-and-customer-in-masks-in-cafe.jpg", "https://data.travelerstoday.com/data/thumbs/full/50156/330/243/50/40/manus-x-machina-fashion-in-an-age-of-technology-costume-institute-gala.jpg", "https://data.travelerstoday.com/data/thumbs/full/50334/330/243/50/40/kuwtk-scott-disick-is-literally-under-fire-at-dinner-e.jpg", "https://data.travelerstoday.com/data/thumbs/full/54618/110/110/50/40/orang-train-between-fall-trees.jpg", "http://b.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=14401431&cv=2.0&cj=1", "https://data.travelerstoday.com/data/thumbs/full/54624/110/110/50/40/man-celebrating-dominican-republic-carnival-wearing-mask-and-costume-of-the-diablo-cojuelo.jpg", "https://assetsorigin.travelerstoday.com/static/common/_v1.2.0/favicon.ico", "https://data.travelerstoday.com/data/thumbs/full/54617/110/110/50/40/yellow-flowers-in-bloom.jpg", "http://pixel.quantserve.com/pixel/p-TV6FPprf929VL.gif", "https://assetsorigin.travelerstoday.com/static/common/_v1.2.0/images/twitter-logo.svg"], "top_img": "https://assetsorigin.travelerstoday.com/static/common/_v1.2.0/favicon.ico", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Travel Today News"], "canonical_link": "https://www.travelerstoday.com/articles/45288/20170411/kim-kardashian-kanye-west-snubbed-kate-middleton-prince-william-report.htm", "title": "Kim Kardashian, Kanye West Snubbed By Kate Middleton And Prince William Report Debunked", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width; initial-scale=1.0; maximum-scale=1.0;", "fb": {"pages": 356658247712915, "app_id": 178288019284900}, "title": "Kim Kardashian, Kanye West Snubbed By Kate Middleton And Prince William Report Debunked", "keywords": "kate middleton, prince william, kim kardashian, kanye west", "description": "Kate Middleton and Prince William were reported to have snubbed Kim Kardashian and Kanye West because the couple turned down invitations to attend West's concerts.

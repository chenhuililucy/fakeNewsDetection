They then visited a saddlery last month and got her all the accessories,' the source added.\n\n\u2018The pony is an extravagant gift but Harper is aware of just how lucky she is.\u2019\n\nHarper\u2019s new 'present' will settle in right at home in the family\u2019s new country home in the Cotswolds where they have their own stables.\n\nEarlier today, Victoria posted a sweet birthday message to her daughter on Instagram with the caption: \u2018Happy Birthday baby girl x We love u so so much x so many kisses!!!\u2019\n\nThe proud mother - who also shares sons Brooklyn, Cruz and Romeo wit her husband of 19 years - also took to Instagram Stories to share videos of inflatable unicorn and heart decorations for Harper\u2019s big day.\n\nInstagram\n\nHappy birthday, Harper!", "images": ["http://www.elle.com/_assets/design-tokens/fre/static/icons/social/pinterest.e8cf655.svg?primary=%2523ffffff&id=social-button-icon",

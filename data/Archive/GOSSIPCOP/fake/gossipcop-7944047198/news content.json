But is Kim convinced Ye is the target?\n\nAccording to Hollywood Life, sources claim the 36-year-old reality TV star is upset about Jay\u2019s lyrics and believes it was an insensitive move.\n\n\u201cShe gets very protective of her husband, like a mama bear [\u2026] She thinks it was a low blow to diss Kanye and throw around words like \u2018insane\u2019 after all he\u2019s been through,\u201d a source told the news site. \u201cKanye had a real difficult time last year and is still coming out of it, so to hit him like that wasn\u2018t cool.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s no secret the Kardashian-West family endured a difficult 2016. After Kim was robbed at gunpoint last October in Paris, Kanye was committed to the UCLA Medical Center for psychological evaluation. The hospitalization shortly after Kanye delivered a series of bizarre rants delivered during his Saint Pablo Tour. One of those rants took aim at Jay and Beyonc\u00e9.\n\n\u201cKim would like nothing more than to drop the whole feud and move on with their lives,\u201d the source told Hollywood Life. \u201cShe likes Bey and Jay and would love to be friends\u2014but it has to be a two-way street. If they aren\u2019t interested then so be it.\u201d", "images":

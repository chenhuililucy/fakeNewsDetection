Is it convention? Is it so other people respect your relationship more? For me, I\u2019m just not quite sure where it fits, especially when it feels so easy to get married, and then there\u2019s like the untangling in terms of the state getting involved.\u201d\n\nThis content is imported from poll. You may be able to find the same content in another format, or you may be able to find more information, at their web site.\n\nThe only immediate benefit Faris could name is that marriage makes people take your relationship more seriously. \u201cThere is the importance of how other people then treat you as a married man as opposed to a man with a girlfriend. I do think it is important how other people respect a relationship\u2014I\u2019m not saying it\u2019s a good reason, but it is a small benefit of having that label of being married.\u201d\n\nFaris later talked about the pressure she and Pratt felt being a beloved, popular Hollywood couple\u2014and the internet's reaction of \"love is dead\" after they announced they were separating. \u201cChris and I did talk about [it]. We got, like on the Twitter feed, yes like \u2018Love is dead\u2019 and \u2018relationship goals,'\u201d she started. \u201cI think what we were also guilty of\u2014although we had an unbelievable marriage and we have a great friendship now, we love our son to death, and I\u2019m really proud of that because I\u2019m not sure I did that well the first time [Faris was married before to Ben Indra from 2004-2008]. But I do think we obviously cultivated something, and it was rewarding for a while. It was like \u2018Oh, People seem to think we got all this shit all right.\u2019\u201d\n\nMore From ELLE\n\nFaris confirmed that \"yes,\" she felt a weird pressure because of her and Pratt's couple fame, especially at the end of their relationship. \"I don\u2019t know if embarrassment [of letting fans down] is quite the right word. Something akin to that. I had a little bit of a childish feeling of \u2018Oh come on, fucking grow up!\u2019 Like, [there was] a little anger. But that\u2019s not fair either, because I cultivated it though,\u201d she explained. \u201cWe intentionally cultivated this idea of like, \u2018Look at this beautiful family.\u2019 There were so many moments that were like that but of course just like anything on social media, you don\u2019t post like, \u2018Where the fuck is the toilet paper?!\u2019 or whatever. I think it\u2019s a very hard forum to be genuine, and I think it does a disservice to people to not be.\"\n\nFaris is currently dating cinematographer Michael Barrett. Pratt and Faris announced their separation in August 2017. \"Anna and I are sad to announce we are legally separating,\" Pratt wrote then. \"We tried hard for a long time, and we\u2019re really disappointed. Our son has two parents who love him very much and for his sake we want to keep this situation as private as possible moving forward. We still have love for each other, will always cherish our time together and continue to have the deepest respect for one another.\"", "images": ["http://www.elle.com/_assets/design-tokens/fre/static/icons/social/pinterest.e8cf655.svg?primary=%2523ffffff&id=social-button-icon", "https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/cardi-b-and-offset-attending-the-vanity-fair-oscar-party-news-photo-1694355966.jpg?crop=0.893xw:0.595xh;0.0417xw,0.0823xh&resize=360:*", "http://www.elle.com/_assets/design-tokens/fre/static/icons/social/youtube.ce3e1ae.svg?primary=%2523ffffff&id=social-button-icon", "https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/anna-faris-1508421940.jpg?resize=640:*", "https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/anna-faris-1508421940.jpg?crop=1xw:1xh;center,top&resize=1200:*", "https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/gettyimages-1738323608-652d36a44c564.jpg?crop=0.829xw:1.00xh;0.0865xw,0&resize=360:*", "https://hips.hearstapps.com/vidthumb/images/elle-burn-ballads-babyface-ak-v1-65283d375ffe8.jpg?crop=1xw:1xh;center,top&resize=480:*", "https://hips.hearstapps.com/ell.h-cdn.co/assets/17/32/1600x800/landscape-1502127551-chris-anna-moments.jpg?resize=300:*", "https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/madelyn-cline-sofia-hublitz-and-pete-davidson-are-seen-in-news-photo-1697380465.jpg?crop=0.909xw:0.606xh;0.0529xw,0.0716xh&resize=360:*", "https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/selena-gomez-gettyimages-1699488086-652d70db4a057.jpg?crop=0.668xw:1.00xh;0.160xw,0&resize=360:*", "http://www.elle.com/_assets/design-tokens/fre/static/icons/social/twitter.c44156b.svg?primary=%2523ffffff&id=social-button-icon", "https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/justin-bieber-and-hailey-bieber-attend-the-2021-met-gala-news-photo-1631970523.jpg?crop=0.771xw:1.00xh;0.115xw,0&resize=360:*", "https://hips.hearstapps.com/rover/profile_photos/67f50b99-742e-4e5d-8197-6e717b23ab3b.jpg?fill=1:1&resize=120:*", "https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/jake-bongiovi-and-british-actress-millie-bobby-brown-arrive-news-photo-1672425305.jpg?crop=0.571xw:0.800xh;0.151xw,0.0449xh&resize=360:*", "https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/frankie-grande-as-frank-n-furter-and-sister-ariana-grande-news-photo-1697392158.jpg?crop=0.825xw:0.580xh;0.0321xw,0.0169xh&resize=360:*", "http://www.elle.com/_assets/design-tokens/fre/static/icons/social/facebook.a5a3a69.svg?primary=currentColor&id=link-out-embed", "https://hips.hearstapps.com/rover/profile_photos/67f50b99-742e-4e5d-8197-6e717b23ab3b.jpg?fill=1:1&resize=160:*", "https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/chris-evans-speaks-at-a-spotlight-panel-during-new-york-news-photo-1697383654.jpg?crop=0.780xw:0.520xh;0.0705xw,0.0576xh&resize=360:*", "https://hips.hearstapps.com/ell.h-cdn.co/assets/17/32/2560x1280/landscape-1502196873-gettyimages-672454252.jpg?resize=300:*", "https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/prince-harry-duke-of-sussex-and-meghan-duchess-of-sussex-news-photo-1697473263.jpg?crop=1.00xw:0.731xh;0,0.0152xh&resize=360:*", "http://www.elle.com/_assets/design-tokens/fre/static/icons/social/facebook.a5a3a69.svg?primary=%2523ffffff&id=social-button-icon", "http://www.elle.com/_assets/design-tokens/fre/static/icons/social/instagram.f282b14.svg?primary=%2523ffffff&id=social-button-icon", "http://www.elle.com/_assets/design-tokens/fre/static/icons/social/pinterest.e8cf655.svg?primary=%2523ffffff", "http://www.elle.com/_assets/design-tokens/elle/static/images/logos/logo.2856426.svg?primary=%2523ffffff", "https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/chris-alba-img-9670-1676401473.jpg?crop=1.00xw:0.757xh;0,0.243xh&resize=360:*", "https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/priyanka-chopra-jonas-and-nick-jonas-pose-backstage-at-the-news-photo-1697387669.jpg?crop=0.934xw:0.706xh;0.0208xw,0.0508xh&resize=360:*", "https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/anna-chris-1505751732.jpg?crop=1.00xw:1.00xh;0,0&resize=300:*", "https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/millie-bobby-brown-jake-bongiovi-gettyimages-1673812984-652d89c52f4e5.jpg?crop=1.00xw:0.668xh;0,0.0513xh&resize=360:*", "http://www.elle.com/_assets/design-tokens/elle/static/images/logos/network-logo.242fea1.svg?primary=%2523ffffff", "http://www.elle.com/_assets/design-tokens/elle/static/images/logos/logo.2856426.svg?primary=navLogoColor"], "top_img": "https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/anna-faris-1508421940.jpg?crop=1xw:1xh;center,top&resize=1200:*", "keywords": [], "authors": [], "canonical_link": "https://www.elle.com/culture/celebrities/a19599365/anna-faris-no-longer-believes-in-marriage-dax-shepard/", "title": "Anna Faris's Divorce With Chris Pratt Has Made Her Question the Point of Marriage", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "X-UA-Compatible": "IE=edge,chrom=1", "msapplication-tap-highlight": "no", "title": "Anna Faris on Chris Pratt Divorce and Public Fall Out -

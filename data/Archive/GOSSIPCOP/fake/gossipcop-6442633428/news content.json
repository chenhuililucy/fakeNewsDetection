(DISCLAIMER: They're not. Put the tissues away.) As expected, the Deadpool action star responded to the post with his signature sense of humor.\n\nThe tweet in question by Yahoo Entertainment, who wrote on Tuesday, \"Ryan Reynolds (@vancityreynolds) joins Blake Lively and his mom on red carpet after shutting down split rumors.\"\n\nBut Reynolds hit back perfectly, responding as if the split rumors were between him and his mom rather than him and Lively. \"We\u2019re never splitting. She\u2019ll always be my mom. No matter how much jazz-cabbage she smokes with her rollerblading friends,\" he replied.\n\nMore From Harper's BAZAAR\n\nThis content is imported from twitter.

When IB Times India tweeted, \"Deadpool Ryan Reynolds and wife Blake Lively struggling to spend 'quality time,'\" the actor hit back, saying, \"I wish. I could use a little 'me time'.\"\n\nThis content is imported from twitter. You may be able to find the same content in another format, or you may be able to find more information, at their web site.

The distance between them has taken its toll.\" But Reynolds quickly debunked the gossip.\n\nDespite his recent online quips, Reynolds most savage burns seemed to be reserved for Blake, as told by his intentionally-cropped birthday greeting and jokes about her new onscreen look.

Who\u2019s the girl?\u201d It featured images of the actor with a mysterious brunette stepping onto a private jet. However, the story didn\u2019t phase the actor too much, and he fired back with the perfect response:\n\n\u201cYou should have heard how upset Mila was that I spent the day with our cousin,\u201d he wrote on Twitter Sunday. \u201cSorry aunt Jodie these magazines lack integrity.\u201d\n\nYou should have heard how upset Mila was that I spent the day with our cousin.

In 2010, he took to Twitter to slam the magazine for claiming he was cheating on his then-wife, Demi Moore.\n\n\u201cI think Star magazine calling me a \u2018cheater\u2019 qualifies as defamation of character,\u201d he wrote. \u201cI hope my lawyer agrees.\u201d", "images": ["https://i0.wp.com/www.thewrap.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Beatrice-Verhoeven.png?resize=150%2C150&ssl=1", "https://www.thewrap.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/AshtonKutcher.jpg", "https://i0.wp.com/www.thewrap.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/AOC-calls-out-Ron-DeSantis-Claim-About-Palestinians.jpg?resize=320%2C180&ssl=1", "https://i0.wp.com/www.thewrap.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Beatrice-Verhoeven.png?fit=53%2C58&ssl=1", "https://i0.wp.com/www.thewrap.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Kelly-Rizzo.png?resize=320%2C180&ssl=1", "https://i0.wp.com/www.thewrap.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Succession-EmmyWrap-Drama-Cover-1.jpg?fit=250%2C300&ssl=1", "https://i0.wp.com/www.thewrap.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/oprah.jpg?resize=320%2C180&ssl=1", "https://i0.wp.com/www.thewrap.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/drag-race-philippines-world-of-wonder.jpg?resize=320%2C180&ssl=1", "https://i0.wp.com/www.thewrap.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/AshtonKutcher.jpg?fit=618%2C412&ssl=1"], "top_img": "https://www.thewrap.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/AshtonKutcher.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Beatrice Verhoeven", "Lawrence Yee", "Ross A.

That is, if they even have one anymore.\n\nTo jog your memory, Khlo\u00e9 just gave birth to a baby girl named True and in the same week that happened, rumors of Tristan\u2019s alleged affairs surfaced. Kim and other members of the Kardashian-Jenner family had flown out to Cleveland, Ohio to be by Khlo\u00e9\u2019s side when she gave birth, and Kim is graciously sharing what it\u2019s been like ever since.\n\nIn a sneak-peek released last week, Kim said it's not going that great for the youngest Kardashian sister.\n\nIn Kim\u2019s interview with Ellen DeGeneres, Kim said, \"Like, I don\u2019t even know how to describe it besides it\u2019s just so f*cked up.\" Indeed it is, Kim.\n\nMore From Cosmopolitan\n\nThis content is imported from poll. You may be able to find the same content in another format, or you may be able to find more information, at their web site.\n\nAnd in the full interview clip, Kim said Khlo\u00e9 is taking some time for herself and True and isn't making any hasty decisions about her and Tristan's relationship.\n\nAccording to Kim, Khlo\u00e9 is currently alone in Cleveland to have time to bond with her baby and is still on the fence about whether or not she and Tristan will stay together.\n\n\"You know, I think she\u2019s not thinking of anything,\" Kim said. \"I think she just wants a clear head and just wants to be alone with her baby and figure that out and the family\u2019s flown out there a few times.\"\n\nShe went on to say, \"I think it must be so hard to have your heart broken and fall in love all in a day or two, all happening at the same time and I think she just needs some [space].\"\n\nKim said her whole family is just trying to be supportive of Khlo\u00e9.\n\n\"We really were rooting for Khlo\u00e9, and we still are. She's so strong and she's doing the best that she can. It's a really sad situation all over.\"\n\nThe only thing she didn't talk about was if she ever liked Tristan.\n\nWhen Ellen asked her about her opinion of Tristan, Kim danced around the question and threw some shade toward him.\n\n\"I kind of made this rule with my brother, if there's a baby involved, I'm not going to talk. I'm going to keep it cute and keep it classy and not talk too bad. I'm going to try not to say anything so negative because one day True is going to see this.\"\n\nAnd there you have it folks, a prime example of if you don't have anything nice to say, don't say anything at all.\n\nThis content is imported from poll.

After it was reported that she and Blake Shelton tied the knot in a secret ceremony, the No Doubt frontwoman was sporting an apparent baby bump during an outing with her son on Sunday, August 13.\n\nIn some photos obtained by HollywoodLife.com, Gwen was donning a black maxi dress which featured floral prints on it. She paired it with a pair of sandals and accessorized with bracelets and necklaces. Gwen completed her look with a silver handbag.\n\nShe was accompanied by her youngest son Apollo, who looked adorable in a black T-shirt. They looked relaxed as they were walking down the street hand-in-hand. At one point, Gwen could be seen cradling her growing belly.\n\nPrior to this, Gwen was believed to be pregnant with twins and wanted to ask Beyonce Knowles for advice. \"Word is they run in [Gwen's] family, on her dad's side,\" a source revealed. \"And friends are saying she's been talking constantly about Beyonce's pregnancy and wanting to reach out to her for advice. People are starting to put two and two together.\"\n\nThe source explained that the \"4 in the Morning\" songstress was \"dying to see [Blake] with little babies\" and wanted the country crooner to father her three sons. \"Gwen and Blake really feel fate brought them together and continues to bless them with this promise of more kids.

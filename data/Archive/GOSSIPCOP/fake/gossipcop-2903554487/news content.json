At least 35 people were killed, scores went missing and thousands more languished in shelters.\n\nThe communist country has since suspended its hydropower strategy to become the \"battery of Asia\" by damming rivers and selling electricity to its neighbours.", "images": ["https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2023/10/17/01/76637681-0-image-a-71_1697502461332.jpg",

Though you may not have known it, for the past few weeks, HBO has been unspooling bits and pieces of behind-the-scenes glimpses at Season 7 in a series called \u201cThe Game Revealed.\u201d (Click here if you haven\u2019t eaten recently and want to know just how much work went into turning actor Iain Glen into a crusty, greyscale-infected mess.) The latest video in the series covers one of the most universally popular moments of the past season: the fight between Brienne of Tarth and Arya Stark of Winterfell.\n\nThere was already a lot to admire in this scene, from the thematic reveals to the impressive fact that the right-handed Maisie Williams has to (at her own insistence) train for all her fight scenes using her left hand. (In the books, Arya, like Inigo Montoya, fights left-handed.) But what we didn\u2019t know is that at least some version of the fight involved some insane acrobatics. It\u2019s probably wise that the show cut these extra tumbling moves.\n\nThose are Gwendoline Christie and Maisie Williams\u2019s stunt doubles at work there, and at least one of them makes another appearance in the video. Though I wasn\u2019t foolish enough to think that Williams had done every single step of this fight herself, I was surprised to see her double execute one of the showstopping moves: a flip followed by an elaborate sword flourish. Thanks to some seamless C.G.I. work on the double\u2019s face, I thought for sure that was Williams executing the move on screen.", "images":

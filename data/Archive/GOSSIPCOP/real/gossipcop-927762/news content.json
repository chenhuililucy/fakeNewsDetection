The Pulitzer board said Monday the album is a \u201cvirtuosic song collection\u201d and said it captures \u201cthe modern African American life.\u201d He will win $15,000.\n\nLamar has been lauded for his deep lyrical content, politically charged live performances, and his profound mix of hip-hop, spoken word, jazz, soul, funk, poetry and African sounds. Since emerging on the music scene with the 2011 album \u201cSection.80,\u201d he has achieved the perfect mix of commercial appeal and critical respect.\n\nThe Pulitzer board has awarded special honors to Bob Dylan, Duke Ellington, George Gershwin, Thelonious Monk, John Coltrane and Hank Williams, but a popular figure like Lamar has never won the prize for music. In 1997, Wynton Marsalis became the first jazz act to win the Pulitzer Prize for music.\n\nThat makes Lamar\u2019s win that much more important: His platinum-selling major-label albums \u2014 \u201cgood kid, m.A.A.d city,\u201d \u201dTo Pimp a Butterfly\u201d and \u201cDAMN.\u201d \u2014 became works of art, with Lamar writing songs about blackness, street life, police brutality, perseverance, survival and self-worth. His piercing and sharp raps helped him become the voice of the generation, and easily ascend as the leader in hip-hop and cross over to audiences outside of rap, from rock to pop to jazz. He\u2019s also been a dominator on the charts, having achieved two dozen Top 40 hits, including a No. 1 success with \u201cHumble,\u201d and he has even collaborated with the likes of U2, Taylor Swift, Imagine Dragons, Rihanna and Beyonce.\n\nHis music, with songs like \u201cAlright\u201d and \u201cThe Blacker the Berry,\u201d have become anthems in the wake of high-profile police shootings of minorities as the conversation about race relations dominates news headlines. He brought of dose of seriousness to the 2015 BET Awards, rapping on top of a police car with a large American flag waving behind him. At the 2016 Grammys, during his visual-stunning, show-stopping performance, he appeared beaten, in handcuffs, with chains around his hands and bruises on his eyes as he delivered powerful lyrics to the audience.\n\nLamar\u2019s musical success helped him win 12 Grammy Awards, though all three of his major-label albums have lost in the top category \u2014 album of the year. Each loss has been criticized by the music community, launching the conversation about how the Recording Academy might be out of touch. \u201cDAMN.\u201d lost album of the year to Bruno Mars\u2019 \u201c24K Magic\u201d in January.\n\nThe rapper, born in Compton, California, was hand-picked by \u201cBlack Panther\u201d director Ryan Coogler to curate an album to accompany the ubiquitously successful film, giving Lamar yet again another No. 1 effort and highly praised project.\n\n\u201cDAMN.,\u201d released on April 14, 2017, won five Grammys, including best rap album, and the album topped several year-end lists by critics, including NPR, Rolling Stone, Pitchfork, BBC News, Complex and Vulture.\n\nFinalists for the Pulitzer Prize in music were Michael Gilbertson\u2019s \u201cQuartet,\u201d which debuted last February at Carnegie Hall, and Ted Hearne\u2019s \u201cSound from the Bench,\u201d a 35-minute cantata released last March.", "images":

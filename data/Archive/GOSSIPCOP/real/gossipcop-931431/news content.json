News that although Ortiz-Magro and Harley have a \"tumultuous\" relationship, she hopes they can work it out.\n\n\"There are a lot of tumultuous reality relationships, so you never know. I mean, they have a kid together, so hopefully they could work it out,\" Scheana said. \"I know that's what he wanted. But not everyone can work, not everyone is compatible.\"\n\n\n\nMore From Cosmopolitan\n\nThe Bravo reality star then noted that Ortiz-Magro and Harley didn't get to know each other that well before expecting their first child together.\n\n\"I mean they weren't together very long before she got pregnant, so you never know,\" Scheana said. \"But hopefully even if the relationship doesn't work out, I hope they can come together for their daughter and just be good co-parents.\"\n\nScheana Marie is all too familiar with the hardships of a bad relationship. The 32-year-old filed for divorce from her husband of two years Mike Shay in November 2016, and the couple finalized the split in May 2017.\n\nMeanwhile, Ortiz-Magro and Harley are trying their best to stay on speaking terms for the sake of their 1-month-old daughter Ariana Sky, People reports.\n\n\u201cThey are going to have to work out the visitation stuff once the dust settles,\u201d a source told the publication, adding that the former couple are \"speaking civilly and trying to make sure Ariana has the best life possible.\u201d\n\n\n\nOn Monday, Harley posted a video on Instagram Live that showed she and Ortiz-Magro in the middle of a heated argument. Ortiz-Magro later issued an apology, stating, \"I acted on my gut and not rationally. I should've never acted in such a manor [sic].\"\n\nThis content is imported from poll.

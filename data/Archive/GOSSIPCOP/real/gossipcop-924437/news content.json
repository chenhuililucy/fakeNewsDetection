But Mandy Moore is not most people. While on break from filming This Is Us, she decided to go and climb Mount Kilimanjaro. No big deal.\n\nMoore made the trip alongside her fianc\u00e9, Taylor Goldsmith, and a group of friends. She started her adventure on March 23, and posted a photo of her climbing crew on Instagram. \u201cI\u2019ve been dreaming of seeing [the mountain] and doing this since I was 18,\u201d she wrote.\n\nAnd after the trip ended and she got service back, she posted photos from the climb. \u201cI lived out one of the most rewarding and challenging experiences of my life with a few of my best friends,\u201d she wrote.\n\nMore From Cosmopolitan\n\nMoore explained that getting to the summit of the mountain was incredibly grueling, dealing with awful weather, freezing temperatures, and total darkness. \u201cReaching the threshold of the true summit was more emotional and overwhelming than I had thought possible,\u201d she wrote. \u201cThere\u2019s nothing more empowering than realizing that we are all capable of so much more than we give ourselves credit for.\u201d\n\nRead her full caption below:\n\n\u201cOn the night of our ascent to the summit, we woke up at 11pm (after a few hours of napping) to enjoy a couple of nervous minutes together with a cup of coffee before it was time to gear up in my our warmest layers and start the nearly 8 hour trek to highest point in Africa- 19,341 ft. In total darkness, we took it pole pole (slow slow) and trudged through rain, sleet and snow, where seemingly everything on our person managed to freeze (water bottles, backpacks, our eyelashes, hair, fingers, toes, etc...) Oddly, I\u2019ve never felt more determined to tackle such a physical challenge before and yet the combined elements of exhaustion and extremely cold weather made it much trickier than any of us were prepared for.\n\nAll of that aside, ultimately reaching the threshold of the true summit was more emotional and overwhelming than I had thought possible. Kilimanjaro demands a lot from those who traverse her trails. You have no choice but to show up. And we did. There\u2019s nothing more empowering than realizing that we are all capable of so much more than we give ourselves credit for.\u201d", "images":

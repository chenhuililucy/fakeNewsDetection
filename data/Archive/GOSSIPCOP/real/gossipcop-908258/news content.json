She recalled how she was \u201ccaught off guard\u201d and \u201cstumbled\u201d through an interview when she first spoke about the scandal.\n\n\u201cI realized I gave the impression I was not fully supportive of my teammates. I stumbled through my words because I couldn\u2019t even begin to process my thoughts, let alone my words, about his abhorrent and criminal actions,\u201d she added.\n\nALY RAISMAN FACES ABUSER LARRY NASSAR IN COURT: '(WE) ARE A FORCE AND YOU ARE NOTHING'\n\nLiukin then pledged all proceeds for the Nastia Liukin Cup, her upcoming gymnastics competition, to be donated to an organization supporting victims of sexual abuse.\n\n\u201cMy hope is this is the beginning of positive change,\u201d she said. \u201cI am here for not just these young athletes but for all young women who want and deserve to feel and to be safe.\u201d\n\nLiukin also revealed her father is the coach of the Women\u2019s National Team and working to \u201cchange the culture and environment of this program.\u201d\n\n\u201cTo all the women who have come forward: you are my role models, my heroes, and I will forever respect you and be inspired by your bravery and commitment to making our world a better and safer place,\u201d she said.\n\nMore than 80 victims, including Olympic gymnasts Aly Raisman and McKayla Maroney, testified against Nassar, describing the impact of being assaulted by him. Nassar admitted molesting athletes during treatment when he was employed by Michigan State University and USA Gymnastics.\n\nNassar has already been sentenced to 60 years in prison for child pornography crimes. He faces a minimum prison sentence of 25 to 40 years in the molestation case.", "images":

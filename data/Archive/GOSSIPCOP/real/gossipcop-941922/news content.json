It was just a polaroid of himself, with the caption \"hooray romano.\"\n\nAnd it was enough for his fianc\u00e9e Ariana Grande for life. Grande commented twice under the photo, writing \"where the mixtape\" and then \"this is sick and ur page looks cool never post again.\"\n\nInstagram\n\nOf course she's just joking as they did when they were posting Instagrams regularly and commenting on the other's every photo in the summer. The two chose to take a social media break in late July because of the negative comments the couple was receiving.\n\nMore From ELLE\n\nDavidson didn't only post on his page yesterday, either. On Grande's page, Davidson liked her two most recent Instagrams and posted his own comment on her latest photo of herself. He made it clear then that his return to the platform was very temporary and hey, belated like to all the photos Grande posted that he missed. \"Hot. All the ones you posted with me not online are hot. Love ya. Bye for another 3 months,\" he wrote.\n\nInstagram\n\nGrande had this response to Davidson, naturally: \"Good thing ur sitting next to me and I see u every second and nothing important happens online that I don't show u anyway. Bye. Ily.\"\n\nInstagram\n\nThis content is imported from poll.

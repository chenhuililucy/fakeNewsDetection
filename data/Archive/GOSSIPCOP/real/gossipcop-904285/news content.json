The director spoke only Japanese, so we communicated through an interpreter. We talked briefly about how well the camera tests had gone and how excited we were about the project. Then he told me there was something specific he had come to discuss: the issue of my weight. He said the film studio would provide a trainer and a meal plan for me and it would be great if I could lose roughly five pounds before we began shooting.\n\nIt took me years to find the humor in being asked to lose such a relatively minimal number of pounds through an interpreter. I was 5 feet 7 inches tall and weighed just 120 pounds. I remember this number precisely because five pounds lighter would make me 115 pounds, which is the number I ended up achieving after I spent two weeks eating only the deli meat off Subway sandwiches and skipping dinners altogether.\n\nWomen have always had to carry the burden of molding the shapes and sizes of our bodies to the trends and tastes of others, at any cost. We are assigned a look. We don\u2019t get to choose.\n\nFor most actresses on red carpets, what you\u2019re wearing is less an expression of who you are and more an expression of what you\u2019re worth. The very act of getting ready for an award show can be a masochist\u2019s checklist of one\u2019s value: Airbrush your arms so that they look more toned. Check. Get a peel or injection to make sure your face looks flawless. Check. Lose bloat by eating only before 6 p.m. and stop drinking all liquid 24 hours before the big day to send your metabolism into shock. Check. Prepping for award shows can be a weeklong marathon in dread, resulting in a one-time portrayal of improbable beauty.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Sign Up for the Opinion Today Newsletter Every weekday, get thought-provoking commentary from Op-Ed columnists, the Times editorial board and contributing writers from around the world.

Platform high heels and frilly dresses and a clutch purse made from the skin of dead baby lizards. I\u2019ve spent the better part of my two decades as an actress accumulating more designer high heels than most could ever dream of, only to hit my 30s and realize I hated wearing most of them and always had. Years ago when I was nominated for a Golden Globe for best actress in a television drama, I had a full anxiety attack after the dress fitting, even though I had found a beautiful dress that fit me nicely. I found myself in my car, the air-conditioning on full blast, sobbing into my steering wheel. The anxiety I was feeling wasn\u2019t about the dress itself. It was about the fulfillment of the obligations of the dress.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nNot all actresses loathe getting ready for award shows, though. For some, the act of dressing up is a joy that comes quite naturally. For example, one of my best friends is the actress Blake Lively, who has such extraordinary taste in fashion and clothing. I often find myself texting her to get advice on what to wear to an event where I know there will be cameras present. She is always helpful and thoughtful about what will look best on me, a favor I can\u2019t ever seem to do for myself no matter how hard I try. In recent years, I\u2019ve become far more comfortable in my skin and on red carpets, and I\u2019ve had the good fortune of working with stylists such as Karla Welch and Sarah Slutsky who don\u2019t dress a woman\u2019s body as if it\u2019s a tree hungry for ornaments, but rather an individual, unique body with its own sweet purpose and design.", "images": ["https://web.archive.org/web/20180107203159im_/https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/01/07/opinion/07tamblynWeb/07tamblynWeb-facebookJumbo.jpg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20180107203159im_/https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/01/07/opinion/07tamblynWeb/merlin_131903573_3eda0a47-aef2-443c-b3e4-6d5b75fe2fea-master768.jpg"], "top_img": "https://web.archive.org/web/20180107203159im_/https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/01/07/opinion/07tamblynWeb/07tamblynWeb-facebookJumbo.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Amber Tamblyn"], "canonical_link": "https://web.archive.org/web/20180107203159/https://www.nytimes.com/2018/01/07/opinion/sunday/amber-tamblyn-golden-globes-metoo.html", "title": "Amber Tamblyn: Redefining the Red Carpet", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "sourceApp": "nyt-v5", "applicationName": "article", "al": {"android": {"url": "nytimes://reader/id/100000005646932", "package": "com.nytimes.android", "app_name": "NYTimes"}, "iphone": {"url": "nytimes://www.nytimes.com/2018/01/07/opinion/sunday/amber-tamblyn-golden-globes-metoo.html", "app_store_id": 284862083, "app_name": "NYTimes"}, "ipad": {"url": "nytimes://www.nytimes.com/2018/01/07/opinion/sunday/amber-tamblyn-golden-globes-metoo.html", "app_store_id": 357066198, "app_name": "NYTimes"}}, "twitter": {"app": {"name": {"googleplay": "NYTimes"}, "id": {"googleplay": "com.nytimes.android"}, "url": {"googleplay": "nytimes://reader/id/100000005646932"}}, "site": "@nytimes", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2018/01/07/opinion/sunday/amber-tamblyn-golden-globes-metoo.html", "title": "Opinion | Amber Tamblyn: Redefining the Red Carpet", "description": "At the Golden Globes, my fellow actresses aren\u2019t just wearing black.

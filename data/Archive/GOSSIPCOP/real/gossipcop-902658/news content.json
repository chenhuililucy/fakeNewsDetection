So why not accept those compliments in an updated work wardrobe?\n\nAs an Earth sign, think about pieces that incorporate silver, metallic, grays, and other earthy tones, like deep green, when you\u2019re upgrading to a trendier aesthetic. A cool, glittery dress with an architectural sleeve could work great, especially when toned down and layered beneath a more approachable shirtdress. If the style is pinstriped, more power to you, according to Jake: \u201cPinstripes are important to a Capricorn, because they\u2019re structured and organized, and this sign is all about things falling in line.\u201d Pair with coordinating ankle booties and a geometric bag, and you\u2019ll be getting compliments on your wardrobe as well as on your work ethic.\n\nAs for beauty, be true to your natural self, and rock a fresh face with emphasized brows and freckles.\n\n, $95, , $358; Jennifer Fisher Convertible Globe Duster, $400; Jennifer Fisher Palm Ring, $250, Jennifer Fisher Male Ring, $295; (Available at Shopbop), $375; , $475\n\nBACK TO MENU\n\nLibra season, which is September 22 through October 23, also has great effects on Aquariuses. For you, that translates to traveling and learning about other cultures, so take a break from the daily grind, and go on a road trip with your best friend. \u201cThis is more the kind of trip where you\u2019re not relaxing, you\u2019re involved, exploring cities\u2014it\u2019s a busy feeling,\u201d says Jake.\n\nJake adds that Aquariuses are \u201cthe sign of the zodiac that\u2019s most eccentric, most different, and that factors into their wardrobe too. They\u2019re a bit boho and hippie with a hint of edge.\u201d Don\u2019t be afraid to showcase that aspect of your style while hitting the road. Think: comfy, eye-catching pieces in blues, grays and whites, which will honor your air-sign vibes. Why not wear a pair of roomy wide-leg trousers with a netted top accented with jewels? Top with a pale-blue trench and a cool cap to bring it all together.\n\nFor makeup, get a little quirky, and express yourself. Don't be afraid to take risks with geometric liner\u2014or even a different shadow color for each eye.\n\nLou De Betoly Embellished Top, Price Upon Request; Topshop Plisse Robe Duster Coat, $110; Acne Studios Pants, Stylist\u2019s Own; Shoes, Model\u2019s Own; Eugenia Kim Hat, $275; Jennifer Fisher Palm Earrings, $575\n\nBACK TO MENU\n\n\n\nNot going to lie, fall is going to be an emotional time for you, Pisces. For starters, from November 15 until the new year, Mars is hanging out in your sign. And Neptune makes a cameo on December 7, creating a very heightened, passionate trio. \u201cNeptune is Pisces\u2019 ruling planet, so any action happening to Neptune is felt by Pisces\u2026Neptune is dreamy, intuitive, psychic, and passionate\u2014in conjunction with Mars, it\u2019s also energetic, fiery, and explosive,\u201d Jake says. In other words: Hold tight, because December 7 is going to be a wild ride. But if you spend it with people you love, you just might get even closer to them, bonding like you\u2019ve never been able to before. \u201cMars will be powering up Neptune\u2019s empathetic properties, so having a crazy in-depth heart-to-heart conversation with your girls is likely.\u201d Use this force for good, and have a GNO with your best friends\u2014all while dressing to impress.\n\nPay tribute to Neptune and to your watery roots by wearing deep, sea-green colors, like teal and dark blue, and something roomy on the bottom, like a harem pant or culottes. \u201cWith Neptune being dreamy, a looser, flowy trouser is definitely the way to go,\u201d says Jake. Since this is a girls\u2019 night, though, def get your sexy on in a tighter crop top, which you can wear beneath a bold, patterned overcoat.\n\nHave fun with your makeup look, paying tribute to your sign with an ombr\u00e9 eye that mimics the oil-slick vibes of metallic fish scales.\n\nVersus Versace Jacket, Price Upon Request; , Price Upon Request; , $190; Jennifer Fisher Unicorn Hoops, $325;

I am shocked and absolutely devastated by the loss of my incredible, caring friend. We chased so many intense storms, and I wish we could have just one more storm chase. I'll miss you forever, Joel.

I'll miss you forever, Joel. We lost a legend.\"\n\nMore From Country Living\n\nIn addition to Storm Chasers, Taylor and Timmer also costarred in the 2003 documentary Tornado Glory and the TVNweather.com series Tornado Chasers. Taylor hailed from Oklahoma (part of Tornado Alley, where all three were filmed), specifically the town of Elk City.\n\n\"Our community of Elk City and the Storm Chasing community lost a great guy today,\" a local Facebook page, Team Western OK Chaser, wrote. \"Joel Taylor was truly an inspiration to myself and many who knew him. He was one of the most level headed chasers on the roads and truly a classy guy outside of chasing. He didn't chase for the glory he chased because he had a true passion for storms.\"\n\nThis content is imported from twitter.

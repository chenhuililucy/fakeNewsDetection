Along with her Princess-hood, Ayako also abandons all status and monetary assets associated with being Princess\u2014although CNN reports she was given a $950,000 lump sum for \"living expenses\" upon her marriage to Moriya. Japan's male royals are not required to renounce their titles if they desire to marry a female commoner.\n\nFor the ceremony, Ayako wore a yellow uchiki kimono with floral detail.\n\nMore From

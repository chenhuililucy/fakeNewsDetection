He saw how people reacted to it. He reached out to us and he's like, 'Hey, can I jump on the remix?' and we're like, 'Yes, sir!'\"\n\n\"He did his thing, you know, he sang his verse in English [and then] he sang the chorus in Spanish,\" Fonsi added. \"We were surprised.\"", "images": ["https://media.9news.com/assets/WQAD/images/b1a4e323-7400-4309-9ed3-79366e3922c9/b1a4e323-7400-4309-9ed3-79366e3922c9_16x9.jpg", "https://media.9news.com/assets/KUSA/images/a7d201c8-d8c0-4d5e-a85f-50b62874a539/a7d201c8-d8c0-4d5e-a85f-50b62874a539_360x203.jpg", "https://media.9news.com/assets/KUSA/images/cdf5287e-6cbd-41ae-b874-651eb12e3d6f/cdf5287e-6cbd-41ae-b874-651eb12e3d6f_360x203.jpg", "https://media.9news.com/assets/KUSA/images/a7d201c8-d8c0-4d5e-a85f-50b62874a539/a7d201c8-d8c0-4d5e-a85f-50b62874a539_16x9.jpg", "https://media.9news.com/assets/WQAD/images/b1a4e323-7400-4309-9ed3-79366e3922c9/b1a4e323-7400-4309-9ed3-79366e3922c9_360x203.jpg", "https://media.9news.com/assets/KUSA/images/f450a714-8a75-4a3e-9448-de2abd36bfd4/f450a714-8a75-4a3e-9448-de2abd36bfd4_16x9.jpg", "https://www.9news.com/assets/shared-images/icons/facebook.svg", "https://media.9news.com/assets/KUSA/images/f450a714-8a75-4a3e-9448-de2abd36bfd4/f450a714-8a75-4a3e-9448-de2abd36bfd4_360x203.jpg", "https://www.9news.com/assets/shared-images/icons/close-menu.svg", "https://www.9news.com/assets/shared-images/logos/native/kusa.svg", "http://content.tegna-media.com/photo/2017/06/16/1280set_luis_fonsi_GettyImages632684604_9832113_ver1.0.jpg", "https://www.9news.com/assets/shared-images/logos/kusa.png", "https://media.9news.com/assets/KUSA/images/cdf5287e-6cbd-41ae-b874-651eb12e3d6f/cdf5287e-6cbd-41ae-b874-651eb12e3d6f_16x9.jpg", "https://www.9news.com/assets/shared-images/icons/twitter.svg", "https://www.9news.com/assets/shared-images/weather-icons/clear-day_210x210.png"], "top_img": "http://content.tegna-media.com/photo/2017/06/16/1280set_luis_fonsi_GettyImages632684604_9832113_ver1.0.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": [], "canonical_link": "https://www.9news.com/article/entertainment/entertainment-tonight/luis-fonsi-says-justin-bieber-deserves-a-pass-for-not-knowing-the-lyrics-to-despacito/73-449711767", "title": "Luis Fonsi Says Justin Bieber Deserves a 'Pass' for Not Knowing the Lyrics to 'Despacito'", "meta_data": {"theme-color": "#045ea8", "category": "entertainment", "og": {"url": "https://www.9news.com/article/entertainment/entertainment-tonight/luis-fonsi-says-justin-bieber-deserves-a-pass-for-not-knowing-the-lyrics-to-despacito/73-449711767", "title": "Luis Fonsi Says Justin Bieber Deserves a 'Pass' for Not Knowing the Lyrics to 'Despacito'", "description": "Luis Fonsi doesn't blame Justin Bieber for failing to learn the words to \"Despacito.\"The singer-songwriter came to Bieber's defense after the pop star was recorded", "type": "article", "image": {"identifier": "http://content.tegna-media.com/photo/2017/06/16/1280set_luis_fonsi_GettyImages632684604_9832113_ver1.0.jpg", "width": 1140, "height": 641}, "article": {"published_time": "6/16/2017 2:37:00 PM"}, "site_name": "KUSA.com", "locale": "en_US"}, "article": {"opinion": "false", "content_tier": "free", "section": "9news,entertainment,entertainment-tonight"}, "twitter": {"title": "Luis Fonsi Says Justin Bieber Deserves a 'Pass' for Not Knowing the Lyrics to 'Despacito'", "image": "http://content.tegna-media.com/photo/2017/06/16/1280set_luis_fonsi_GettyImages632684604_9832113_ver1.0.jpg", "card": "summary_large_image", "site": "9NEWS", "description": "Luis Fonsi doesn't blame Justin Bieber for failing to learn the words to \"Despacito.\"The singer-songwriter came to Bieber's defense after the pop star was recorded", "domain": "www.9news.com/"}, "viewport": "width=1170", "site": "9news.com", "description": "<p>Luis Fonsi doesn't blame Justin Bieber for failing to learn the words to \"Despacito.\"</p><p>The singer-songwriter came to Bieber's defense after the pop star was recorded <a href=\"http://www.etonline.com/news/218321_justin_bieber_doesn_t_remember_the_spanish_words_to_despacito_watch/\" target=\"_blank\">butchering the lyrics</a> to the Spanish-language hit single during an appearance at 1Oak in New York City last month.</p>", "fb": {"app_id": 1760372210700146}, "robots": "max-image-preview:large"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1497595020.0, "source": "https://www.9news.com", "summary": ""}

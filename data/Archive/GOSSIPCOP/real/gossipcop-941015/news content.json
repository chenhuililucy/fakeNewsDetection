Clarke and Momoa each posted shots of them posing by the Throne. They also got straight-up gushy about each other in their captions, as they have in the past.\n\n\"FYI...This is the closest you\u2019ll ever get to me attempting \u2018that lift\u2019 from dirty dancing,\" Clarke wrote on her Insta. \"Yes, my man is sitting. Yes, there\u2019s no lake. And yes, I have no idea I\u2019m NOT being raised above his head. (Id like to take a moment to thank alcohol for giving me courage to attempt this. Ever.)\"\n\nMomoa wrote the most adoring comment on her 'gram: \"Epic night love u my love enjoy every moment so proud of you.\"\n\nMore From ELLE\n\nInstagram\n\nHe posted several shots of them too, writing, \"Moon of my life @emilia_clarke every time I leave you my face hurts from smiling to much. I Fucking love you forever. Aloha j\"\n\nClarke liked the shot:\n\nInstagram\n\nBoth Momoa and Clarke shared shots from the party of them with other cast members, hinting they may have been at the wrap party for the series. \"I\u2019m so grateful to be apart of the greatest show on earth. I\u2019m honored to be able to come to Ireland and celebrate with my friends. I\u2019m just here for kisses and hugs and The black stuff \ud83d\ude1c\ud83d\ude1c\ud83d\ude1c\ud83d\ude1c,\" Momoa wrote, perhaps to debunk rumors his character may be making a surprise last-season appearance. \"Mahalo David and Dan you are legends. Congrats to the talented crew and cast.\"\n\nInstagram\n\n\n\n\n\nClarke told Vanity Fair that she shot Daenerys' final scene earlier this year. \"It fucked me up,\" she said. \"Knowing that is going to be a lasting flavor in someone\u2019s mouth of what Daenerys is... \"", "images":

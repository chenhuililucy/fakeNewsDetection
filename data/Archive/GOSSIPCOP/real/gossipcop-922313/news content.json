But still.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn a game of \u201cSpill Your Guts Or Fill Your Guts\u201d with fellow guest John Boyega and host James Corden, Barrymore was faced with the choice of eating a turkey testicle or responding to Corden\u2019s demand to \u201crank your costars from most to least talented.\u201d\n\nThe choices were Gyllenhaal (whom she appeared with in \u201cDonnie Darko\u201d), Adam Sandler (\u201cThe Wedding Singer\u201d and others), and Hugh Grant (\u201cMusic And Lyrics\u201d).\n\nBarrymore tabbed Gyllenhaal as the weakest thespian. Reminded by Corden that she had to rank them from most to least talented, she answered: Adam, Hugh, Jake.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m sorry, Jake,\u201d she said. \u201cIt was the turkey testicle.\u201d\n\nThe exchange begins around the 7:30 mark above.", "images": ["https://pixel.quantserve.com/pixel/p-3aud4J6uA4Z6Y.gif", "https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6723616&c3=&c4=&c5=&c6=&c15=&cj=1", "https://www.facebook.com/tr?id=1621685564716533&ev=PageView&noscript=1", "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5ab392271e00008e0b7af657.png?ops=1200_630", "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5cd400b62100005900d41396.jpg?ops=100_100", "data:image/png;base64,iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAAAAEAAAABCAQAAAC1HAwCAAAAC0lEQVR42mNkYAAAAAYAAjCB0C8AAAAASUVORK5CYII="], "top_img": "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5ab392271e00008e0b7af657.png?ops=1200_630", "keywords": [], "authors": ["General Assignment Reporter"], "canonical_link": "https://www.huffpost.com/entry/drew-barrymore-jake-gyllenhaal_n_5ab38045e4b0decad046f2d2", "title": "Drew Barrymore Calls Jake Gyllenhaal Her Least-Talented Costar", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, minimum-scale=1.0", "description": "\"I'm sorry, Jake.\"", "keywords": "Arts and Entertainment,Celebrities,james corden,the late late show,Drew Barrymore,Jake Gyllenhaal", "fb": {"app_id": 46744042133}, "og": {"title": "Drew Barrymore Calls Jake Gyllenhaal Her Least-Talented Costar", "type": "article", "image": {"identifier": "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5ab392271e00008e0b7af657.png?ops=1200_630", "url": "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5ab392271e00008e0b7af657.png?ops=1200_630", "type": "image/png", "width": 1200, "height": 630}, "url": "https://www.huffpost.com/entry/drew-barrymore-jake-gyllenhaal_n_5ab38045e4b0decad046f2d2", "site_name": "HuffPost", "locale": "en_US", "description": "\"I'm sorry, Jake.\""}, "article": {"tag": "Arts and Entertainment,Celebrities,james corden,the late late show,Drew Barrymore,Jake Gyllenhaal", "section": "Entertainment", "published_time": "2018-03-22T12:32:09Z", "modified_time": "2018-03-22T12:32:09Z"}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "site": "@HuffPostEnt", "title": "Drew Barrymore Calls Jake Gyllenhaal Her Least-Talented Costar", "image": {"identifier": "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5ab392271e00008e0b7af657.png?ops=1200_630", "width": 1200, "height": 630}, "description": "\"I'm sorry, Jake.\""}, "al": {"ios": {"url": "huffpostnews:///?editionID=us&entryID=us_5ab38045e4b0decad046f2d2", "app_store_id": 306621789, "app_name": "HuffPost"}}, "robots": "max-snippet:-1,max-image-preview:large,max-video-preview:-1", "google-site-verification": "97Mj-wW7u8U1NOnkW1rfH-I1kgO0-a9YsgoesOk41R8"}, "movies": ["https://www.youtube.com/embed/jzIE_oKG9PU?rel=0&showinfo=0&enablejsapi=1"], "publish_date": 1521721929.0, "source": "https://www.huffingtonpost.com", "summary": ""}

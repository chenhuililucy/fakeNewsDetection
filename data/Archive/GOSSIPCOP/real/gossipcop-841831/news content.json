This was revealed by her twin sister, Nikki Bella, in an interview early this week.\n\n\"Total Divas\" star Nikki, who recently got engaged to John Cena at WrestleMania33, dished to E! Online details regarding the wrestler who is expected to pop in less than a month. Brie is currently 37 weeks pregnant and Nikki said pregnancy has been great for her.\n\n\"She's in the stage where she is getting a bit uncomfortable and can't wait to have the baby. But she looks so beautiful pregnant, she has this amazing glow,\" said Nikki.\n\nShe also added that her twin sister looks like she is due any minute and that she is excited to be an aunt. Nikki jokingly said that she wanted her niece to look like Brie so she could be her mini-me. The female wrestler revealed that she can no longer wait for her sister's baby to come out so she could start shopping for her.\n\n\"When Brie and Bryan go on their hikes through wherever for two weeks, I can take Birdie and deck her out in Chanel, Louie Vuitton and we won't tell Bryan,\" she jested, adding that she can't wait to have such fun days with her niece.\n\nAccording to Nikki, Brie's belly is already too big to fit into her old clothes. Brie also posted on Instagram that at 37 weeks, she's starting to fit only in her husband's clothes.\n\nNikki went on to describe having a niece as something \"so surreal.\" During the interview, there was no hiding her excitement for baby Birdie's arrival.\n\nWhile her twin sister is getting ready for childbirth, Nikki is getting ready to tie the knot with Cena, who proposed to the wrestler last week.", "images": ["https://cdn.christianpost.com/assets/img/social/original/linkedin.svg", "https://cdn.christianpost.com/assets/img/favicons/apple-touch-icon.png", "https://cdn.christianpost.com/images/cache/image/14/77/147789_a_66_66.jpg", "https://cdn.christianpost.com/images/cache/image/14/95/149582_a_963_642_7_7.jpg", "https://www.christianpost.com/assets/img/logo.svg", "https://cdn.christianpost.com/assets/img/social/original/whatsapp.svg", "https://cdn.christianpost.com/images/cache/thumbnail/25/60/256051_a_66_66.jpg", "https://cdn.christianpost.com/assets/img/icon/email-outline.svg", "https://cdn.christianpost.com/images/cache/image/15/06/150660_a_66_66.jpg", "https://cdn.christianpost.com/images/cache/image/15/06/150664_a_66_66.jpg", "https://cdn.christianpost.com/images/cache/image/9/71/97122_a_66_66.jpg", "https://cdn.christianpost.com/images/cache/thumbnail/25/59/255935_a_130_72.jpg", "https://cdn.christianpost.com/assets/img/brands/christian-today.svg", "https://cdn.christianpost.com/assets/img/icon/link.svg", "https://cdn.christianpost.com/assets/img/icon/close.svg", "https://cdn.christianpost.com/assets/img/icon/print-outline.svg", "https://cdn.christianpost.com/assets/img/brands/crossmap.svg", "https://cdn.christianpost.com/assets/img/icon/share-outline.svg", "https://cdn.christianpost.com/assets/img/social/original/telegram.svg", "https://cdn.christianpost.com/images/cache/image/15/06/150689_a_66_66.jpg", "https://cdn.christianpost.com/assets/img/brands/bible-portal.svg", "https://cdn.christianpost.com/assets/img/brands/breathe-cast.jpg", "https://cdn.christianpost.com/images/cache/image/15/06/150669_a_130_72_7_7.png", "https://cdn.christianpost.com/assets/img/cp.svg", "https://cdn.christianpost.com/images/cache/thumbnail/25/60/256046_a_130_72.jpg", "https://www.christianpost.com/assets/img/cp.svg", "https://cdn.christianpost.com/assets/img/brands/gnl.svg", "https://cdn.christianpost.com/assets/img/icon/chat-rect.svg", "https://cdn.christianpost.com/images/cache/image/15/06/150674_a_66_66.jpg", "https://cdn.christianpost.com/images/cache/image/15/06/150644_a_66_66.jpg", "https://cdn.christianpost.com/assets/img/social/original/facebook.svg", "https://cdn.christianpost.com/images/cache/image/14/50/145014_a_130_72_7_7.png", "https://cdn.christianpost.com/assets/img/brands/edifi.svg", "https://cdn.christianpost.com/images/cache/thumbnail/25/58/255842_a_130_72_799_404.jpg", "https://cdn.christianpost.com/images/cache/image/15/06/150627_a_66_66.jpg", "https://cdn.christianpost.com/images/cache/thumbnail/25/59/255912_a_130_72_567_637.jpg", "https://cdn.christianpost.com/assets/img/social/original/pinterest.svg", "https://cdn.christianpost.com/images/cache/image/14/37/143756_a_66_66.jpg", "https://cdn.christianpost.com/assets/img/social/original/twitter.svg", "https://cdn.christianpost.com/assets/img/brands/vide-press.svg", "https://cdn.christianpost.com/assets/img/logo.svg", "https://cdn.christianpost.com/images/cache/image/15/06/150627_a_130_72_565_167.jpg", "https://cdn.christianpost.com/images/cache/image/14/17/141711_a_66_66.jpg", "https://cdn.christianpost.com/assets/img/social/original/reddit.svg", "https://cdn.christianpost.com/images/cache/image/15/06/150625_a_130_72_7_7.jpg", "https://cdn.christianpost.com/images/cache/thumbnail/25/58/255888_a_130_72.jpg", "https://cdn.christianpost.com/images/cache/image/15/06/150677_a_66_66.png", "https://cdn.christianpost.com/assets/img/thumbup-color.svg"], "top_img": "https://cdn.christianpost.com/assets/img/favicons/apple-touch-icon.png", "keywords": [], "authors": [], "canonical_link": "https://www.christianpost.com/news/wwe-total-divas-star-nikki-bella-talks-about-twin-sister-bries-pregnancy.html", "title": "WWE 'Total Divas' Star Nikki Bella on Twin Sister Brie's Pregnancy", "meta_data": {"description": "Professional female wrestler Brie Bella is about to give birth to her daughter, Birdie Joe Danielson.

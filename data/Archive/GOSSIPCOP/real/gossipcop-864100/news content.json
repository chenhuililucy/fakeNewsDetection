But according to a new report, parents Kate Middleton and Prince William do everything they can to ensure that their children live as normal lives as possible.\n\nRelated Story Kate Middleton Surprises Kids for Charity\n\nUs Weekly reports that, according to a \"royal insider,\" \"William and Kate very much prioritize bringing up the children in as normal an environment as possible.\"\n\nApparently, this normality takes precedence throughout every day, and starts from first thing in the morning.

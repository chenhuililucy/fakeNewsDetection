That's exactly why we fought so hard for the ACA, and why we need to protect it for kids like Billy. And congratulations! https://t.co/77F8rZrD3P \u2014 Barack Obama (@BarackObama) May 2, 2017\n\n\u201cWatch and prepare to tear up,\u201d Hillary Clinton tweeted Tuesday morning. \u201cThanks Jimmy Kimmel for sharing your story and reminding us what\u2019s at stake with health care.\u201d\n\n\u201cIncredibly moving story from @jimmykimmel that shows the true stakes of health policy. So much bigger than politics,\u201d Connecticut Rep. Elizabeth Etsy wrote.\n\n\u201cMORNING READ: An emotional Jimmy Kimmel discusses newborn son\u2019s heart disease, makes passionate health-care plea,\u201d wrote Illinois Sen. Dick Durbin, the minority whip.\n\nKimmel\u2019s wife Molly also took to twitter to post an smiling Billy and an update:\n\nBilly's looking out for a lot of his buddies at Children's Hospital. Remind your Congresspeople to protect them. pic.twitter.com/UbFp2UgqGH \u2014 Molly McNearney (@mollymcnearney) July 21, 2017", "images":

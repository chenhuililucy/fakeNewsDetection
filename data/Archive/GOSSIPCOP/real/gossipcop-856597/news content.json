Surveillance drones buzz constantly from the skies. The highly-secured border is awash with security cameras and soldiers on guard. But Israel\u2019s eyes appeared to have been closed in the lead-up to an unprecedented onslaught by the militant Hamas group, which broke down Israeli border barriers and sent hundreds of militants into Israel to carry out a brazen attack that has killed hundreds. Israel withdrew troops and settlers from the Gaza Strip in 2005. But even after Hamas overran Gaza in 2007, Israel appeared to maintain its edge, using technological and human intelligence. It claimed to know the precise locations of Hamas leadership and appeared to prove it through the assassinations of militant leaders in surgical strikes, sometimes while they slept in their bedrooms. Israel has known where to strike underground tunnels used by Hamas to ferry around fighters and arms. Despite those abilities, Hamas was able to keep its plan under wraps. The ferocious attack, which likely took months of planning and meticulous training and involved coordination among multiple militant groups, appeared to have gone under Israel\u2019s intelligence radar. An Egyptian intelligence official said Egypt, which often serves as a mediator between Israel and Hamas, had spoken repeatedly with the Israelis about \u201csomething big,\u201d without elaborating. He said Israeli officials were focused on the West Bank and played down the threat from Gaza.\n\nNote: According to Efrat Fenigson, a former Israeli soldier who served on the Gaza border, \"A cat moving alongside the fence is triggering all forces.\" How could Israeli intelligence not have known that this attack was coming?

That figure doesn\u2019t include the hundreds of thousands of patients who suffer adverse effects from taking the wrong medication or taking meds in the wrong way. Now, an investigative report from the Los Angeles Times reveals that pharmacies make an estimated 5 million errors every year in California alone, according to the state\u2019s Board of Pharmacy. But even as pharmacy errors mount across the US, pharmaceutical lobbyists are pushing to keep reports of errors hidden from officials and the public. The problem, according to pharmacists and others, is most acute at big retail pharmacy chains such as CVS and Walgreens, where overworked staff are pushed to the limit to meet sales quotas, despite desperate staffing shortages. To combat the rising tide of pharmacy errors, the California State Board of Pharmacy is sponsoring a bill that would require pharmacies to report every error to a third party outside the government. The bill would also allow the pharmacist responsible for the store to increase staffing if the workload has become too overwhelming to keep patients safe. But the bill is opposed by the California Community Pharmacy Coalition, a lobbying group representing retail pharmacies, including the big chains. The coalition believes pharmacy staffing requirements are too strict and it does not want the pharmacy board to have access to the error reports.\n\nNote: For more along these lines, see concise summaries of deeply revealing news articles on corporate corruption and Big Pharma profiteering from reliable major media sources.\n\n2023-06-30, New York Post\n\nPosted: 2023-10-16 01:34:07\n\nOver 30 million Americans a year use benzodiazepines, or \u201cbenzos,\u201d including Xanax, Valium, Ativan and Klonopin. Benzodiazepines are prescribed to treat anxiety disorders, insomnia, muscle spasms, schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, seizures and epilepsy. But this widely used class of drugs is linked to severe side effects and life impacts that can last for years \u2014 even after people have stopped taking the drugs \u2014 a new study finds. \u201cPatients have been reporting long-term effects from benzodiazepines for over 60 years. I am one of those patients,\u201d Dr. Christy Huff, a cardiologist and co-author of the study, said in a news release. The new research, published in PLOS One, includes a lengthy list of side effects that a majority of benzo users experienced more than a year after they stopped taking the drugs. Those long-lasting symptoms include low energy, difficulty focusing, memory loss, anxiety, insomnia, sensitivity to light and sounds, digestive problems, symptoms triggered by food and drink, muscle weakness and body pain. Alarmingly, users also struggled with severe life impacts: 54.7% reported suicide attempts or suicidal thoughts, for example. Health experts noted numerous other problems with benzos, including an increased risk of suicide and dependence on the drug, among other adverse side effects. Withdrawal from benzos can produce troubling symptoms as soon as within 24 hours, and these adverse effects can last for months.\n\nNote: For more along these lines, see concise summaries of deeply revealing news articles on Big Pharma corruption from reliable major media sources.\n\n2023-08-24, New York Post\n\nPosted: 2023-10-16 01:32:35\n\nThe Food and Drug Administration is now regularly approving new drugs after just one or two clinical trials \u2014 a significant departure from the more rigorous vetting process the agency was previously known for, newly published research reveals. Furthermore, the authors say, there\u2019s now less information available to the public about the results of all trials. Of the 37 drugs approved by the FDA last year, 24 (about 65%) were approved based on just one study, according to a paper published in JAMA Network Open. Only four of those 37 drugs, or about 11%, reported three or more studies before approval. Another piece of new research, published in Health Affairs Scholar, found that of the 46 new drugs approved in 2017, 19 of them (41%) were approved based on a single study \u2014 though the drugmakers conducted an average of 2.2 studies per drug, including 165 studies for the popular weight-loss drug Ozempic. The ease with which novel drugs are approved is in part the result of the 21st Century Cures Act, passed in 2016 to speed the approval of new medicines so patients could gain access to life-saving treatments. As part of that law, the FDA relaxed some standards to allow treatments for priority health conditions such as cancer to be approved with fewer supporting studies, and with less emphasis on randomized clinical trials. But in the years following the passage of the 21st Century Cures Act, the FDA has faced a firestorm of criticism over the approval process for some new drugs.\n\nNote: For more along these lines, see concise summaries of deeply revealing news articles on government corruption and Big Pharma profiteering from reliable major media sources.\n\n2023-10-09, The Guardian (One of the UK's Leading Newspapers)\n\nPosted: 2023-10-16 01:30:20\n\nIn December 2010 under the Obama administration, Congress enacted the Healthy, Hunger-Free Kids Act. This legislation provided for more fruits and vegetables in school meal programs, a focus on whole grains and a lot fewer starchy vegetables and trans-fat laden foods. In response, some food companies rejiggered ingredients just enough to add \u201cwhole grain\u201d to their packaging. Things went downhill from there. Congress caved to lobbying in 2014, allowing schools to serve high-salt french fries and pizza sold by these companies. Again, big food lobbied hard and legislators pulled back on restrictions for sodium levels, flavored milks and amounts of refined grains. We in the United States seem to believe that ... education is unconnected to food and how we eat. Instead, our kids are at the mercy of the companies and brands inundating them: Tyson, General Mills, Kraft, Heinz and many others. Before the pandemic began, the overwhelming majority of US schools offered branded foods during or around mealtimes, and that this is worth $20bn in ... profits for the food industry. Pantries and food banks get in bed with corporate food companies because they don\u2019t want to lose access to large quantities of foods and beverages that fill people up. That these products are unhealthy is a secondary or tertiary concern. Food banks and pantries are not always meeting the nutritional profiles of the people they serve, particularly people who are struggling with diabetes, obesity and decades of poor eating.\n\nNote: For more along these lines, see concise summaries of deeply revealing news articles on food system corruption from reliable major media sources.\n\n2023-09-15, Reuters\n\nPosted: 2023-10-16 01:28:08\n\nProcter & Gamble (PG.N), Walgreens (WBA.O) and Johnson & Johnson's (JNJ.N) former consumer business are among several companies accused in lawsuits of deceiving consumers about cold medicines containing an ingredient that a unanimous U.S. Food and Drug Administration advisory panel declared ineffective. Proposed class actions were filed on Wednesday and Thursday, after the panel reviewed several studies and concluded this week that the ingredient phenylephrine marketed as a decongestant was essentially no better than a placebo. According to an agency presentation, about 242 million products with phenylephrine were sold in the United States last year, generating $1.76 billion of sales and accounting for about four-fifths of the market for oral decongestants. The first lawsuit appeared to have been filed in Pensacola, Florida, federal court. It said Johnson & Johnson Consumer and Procter & Gamble should have known by 2018 that their marketing claims about products with phenylephrine were \"false and deceptive.\" That year was when new FDA guidance for evaluating symptoms related to nasal congestion demonstrated that earlier data about phenylephrine's effectiveness could no longer be relied upon, the complaint said. The plaintiff Steve Audelo, a Florida resident, said he bought Johnson & Johnson's Sudafed PE and Benadryl Allergy Plus, and Procter & Gamble's Vicks NyQuil, based on the companies' claims that the products worked.\n\nNote: For more along these lines, see concise summaries of deeply revealing news articles on health and corporate corruption from reliable major media sources.\n\n2023-09-08, Courthouse News\n\nPosted: 2023-10-16 01:26:20\n\nThe United States will continue in a decades long, post-9/11 state of emergency for at least another year. In a Thursday night declaration, President Joe Biden ensured the emergency will extend at least 23 years after coordinated attacks killed nearly 3,000 people in New York, Virginia and Pennsylvania. Biden penned his signature to a one-year extension of President George W. Bush\u2019s Proclamation 7463, retaining broad powers over the organization of the military. The proclamation is officially titled \u201cThe National Emergency with Respect to Certain Terrorist Attacks.\u201d Most emergencies are used to impose economic sanctions. But Proclamation 7463, along with the broad 2001 Authorization for Use of Military Force, gives the president the power to call up the National Guard, alter the size and shape of the military's top officers and hire or fire commissioned officers \u2014 even ordering them out of retirement if necessary. Biden has most recently cited the 2001 authorization to justify drone strikes against al-Shabab militants in Somalia in 2021. The National Emergencies Act, adopted in 1976, requires presidents to renew emergencies each year. Presidents Barack Obama and Donald Trump also extended the 9/11 state of emergency each year of their respective tenures. Trump used it in 2017 to fill a chronic shortage in Air Force pilots. So far, Biden has declared eight new emergencies, continued 34 from his predecessors and ended three.\n\nNote: An article by The Atlantic explores the alarming scope of president\u2019s emergency powers, stating that \u201cthe moment the president declares a \u201cnational emergency\u201d\u2014a decision that is entirely within his discretion\u2014he is able to set aside many of the legal limits on his authority.\u201d For more along these lines, see concise summaries of deeply revealing news articles on government corruption from reliable major media sources.\n\n2023-01-23, Daily Mail (One of the UK's Popular Newspapers)\n\nPosted: 2023-10-16 01:24:16\n\nElon Musk said he had 'major side effects' from his second Covid-19 booster shot that left him feeling like he 'was dying'. Musk, 51, took to Twitter to share his experience of the Covid-19 vaccine in response to a retweet of a poll that said 7 percent of adults claimed they experienced major side effects from the Covid vaccine. The Twitter and Tesla CEO said the second booster 'crushed me'. Musk also shared that his younger cousin, who he said was in 'peak health', had to be hospitalized after his jab suffering from myocarditis. 'I had major side effects from my second booster shot. Felt like I was dying for several days. Hopefully, no permanent damage, but I dunno,' Musk tweeted over the weekend. He added: 'And my cousin, who is young & in peak health, had a serious case of myocarditis. Had to go to the hospital.' Myocarditis is an inflammation of the heart and is named as a possible, but very rare, side effect of Covid-19 vaccinations. A large study published in JAMA Network of more than 192 million people who received Covid vaccines found there were 1,626 cases of myocarditis - a rate of 8.5 cases per million people (0.000845 per cent). Many people have reported side effects from Covid shots, including headaches, a temperature, fatigue and injection site soreness, but in most cases the symptoms only last a few days. When asked why he had gotten the second booster, Musk said that it was not his choice but because it was a requirement fly to Germany.\n\nNote: Explore a list of recent news articles we've summarized that reveal how vaccine-induced myocarditis is not as rare as we're told to believe.

These are often linked to software for facial recognition, access control, behavior analysis, and weapon detection. That is, cameras scan student faces and then algorithms identify them, allow or deny them entry based on that ID, decide if their activities are threatening, and determine if objects they carry may be dangerous or forbidden. \"False hits, such as mistaking a broomstick, three-ring binder, or a Google Chromebook laptop for a gun or other type of weapon, could result in an armed police response to a school,\" cautions the report. Students are aware that they're being observed. Of students aged 14\u201318 surveyed by the ACLU ... thirty-two percent say, \"I always feel like I'm being watched.\"\n\nNote: For more along these lines, see concise summaries of deeply revealing news articles on government corruption and the disappearance of privacy from reliable major media sources.\n\n2023-10-03, Public on Substack\n\nPosted: 2023-10-16 01:21:19\n\nOn April 27, 2021, then-director of the CDC, Rochelle Walensky stated, \u201cwe have not seen any reports\u201d of post-vaccination myocarditis, but this was a false statement. When Walensky claimed to have \u201cnot seen any reports,\u201d there were dozens of reports in the US Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS). \u201cThe CDC,\u201d notes [journalist Zachary] Stieber, \u201cwas warned by Israel on Feb. 28, 2021, about a \u2018large number\u2019 of myocarditis cases after Pfizer COVID-19 vaccination. Internally, the warning was designated as \u2018high\u2019 importance and set off a review of US data.\u201d The Israeli Ministry of Health requested a joint meeting with the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the CDC to respond to this trend. \u201cThe Israeli National Focal Point is noticing a large number of reports of myocarditis, particularly in young people, following the administration of the Pfizer vaccines,\u201d the email stated. Even when more information about myocarditis became public, [Walensky's] agency continued to downplay the risks. Stieber also found that the CDC\u2019s V-Safe self-reporting system did not include a category for myocarditis reports. To this day, the CDC has not released complete, updated data on myocarditis. The agency\u2019s cover-up of adverse cardiac events has had profound consequences and represents a major breach of trust and abuse of authority. Due to the higher risks of myocarditis after Moderna, Sweden, Norway, Finland, Germany, and France suspended the use of the Moderna vaccine for people under 30 two years ago.\n\nNote: When current and former FDA advisers and academics asked the FDA to improve COVID vaccine labeling given the significant risk of severe vaccine injuries, the agency denied almost every single request.

I attended one memorial service in Tel Aviv that rose above these tensions and penetrated to the heart of the issues troubling the country: a meeting of Israeli and Palestinian families who had lost relatives to the conflict and gathered together to share their grief. What was most astonishing about the event was to see the Palestinians fall into the arms of their Israeli hosts and hold on tightly. Why astonishing? Because these days, Palestinians and Israelis almost never come into contact, except at Israeli military checkpoints on the West Bank, or when violent Israeli settlers attack their fields \u2014 or when Palestinian workers come to Israel to work in construction or in agriculture. It was moving in the extreme to see Palestinians and Israelis who had experienced heartbreak at the hands of the other side embrace each other tightly and talk about family. It was also moving to watch thousands of Israelis file into the fenced-off area of the ceremony and fill endless rows of plastic chairs (the organizers say that 300,000 watched online). They listened in total silence as Israeli Jews and Palestinian Muslims told their personal stories on the stage. Yuval Sapir, whose sister Tamar was murdered in Tel Aviv in 1994 by a Palestinian suicide bomber ... choked out these words: \u201cIt is easy and natural to hate ... I chose to try to break the chain of revenge and hatred.\u201d\n\nNote: Explore more positive stories like this in our comprehensive inspiring news articles archive focused on solutions and bridging divides.\n\n2023-10-08, NPR\n\nPosted: 2023-10-16 01:17:27\n\nIn 1968, at the age of 42, psychiatrist Robert Jay Lifton sat down to write Death in Life, a book about his experiences interviewing survivors of the atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki. Over the course of his career, Lifton studied not only survivors of the atomic bombings but Auschwitz survivors, Vietnam war veterans and people who'd been subjected to repression by the Chinese government. The COVID pandemic prompted him to reflect on what he'd learned about mass trauma and resilience \u2013 that telling stories about trauma, and even trying to influence policy, can often help people recover. Now 97, Lifton has just published his 13th book, Surviving Our Catastrophes: Resilience and Renewal from Hiroshima to the Covid-19 Pandemic. \"I interviewed people who had undergone the most extreme kind of trauma and victimization,\" [said Lifton]. \"And yet some of the very same people who had so suffered from trauma have shown what I call \"survivor wisdom\" \u2014 they transformed themselves from helpless victims to agents of survival. If ... storytelling can include the transformation from the helpless victim to the life-enhancing survivor, then the storytelling is crucial. The storytelling we most encourage is that kind that enables the formerly helpless victim to be transformed in the story, to transform himself or herself, collectively transform themselves into life-affirming survivors. That's the key transformation, and that's the story we [listeners] seek to help them achieve.\"\n\nNote: Explore more positive stories like this in our comprehensive inspiring news articles archive focused on solutions and bridging divides.\n\n2023-10-09, NPR\n\nPosted: 2023-10-16 01:15:59\n\nAfter a decline in nutrition education in U.S. schools in recent decades, there's new momentum to weave food and cooking into the curriculum again. Remember the hands-on cooking in home economics class, which was a staple in U.S. schools for decades? \"I'd love to see it brought back and have the science around healthy eating integrated,\" says Stacy Dean, deputy under secretary for food, nutrition and consumer services at the U.S. Department of Agriculture. Dean told me she was inspired by a visit to Watkins Elementary, in Washington, D.C., where this idea is germinating. Students grow vegetables in their school garden. They also roll up their sleeves in the school's kitchen to participate in a FRESHFARM FoodPrints class, which integrates cooking and nutrition education. Evaluations show participation in FRESHFARM programs is associated with increased preference for fruits and vegetables. And, the CDC points to evidence that nutrition education may help students maintain a healthy weight and can also help students recognize the connection between food and emotional wellbeing. Given the key role diet plays in preventing chronic disease, the agency says it would be ideal to offer more nutrition education. Programs like FRESHFARM can help kids expand their palettes by introducing them to new tastes. At first, many kids are turned off by the bitter taste of greens. But through the alchemy of cooking, caramelizing the onions, and blending in fresh ginger, kids can be inspired.\n\nNote: Explore more positive stories like this in our comprehensive inspiring news articles archive focused on solutions and bridging divides.\n\n2023-10-02, Washington Post\n\nPosted: 2023-10-08 19:52:59\n\nLynn and Paul were sitting in their Seattle home one night earlier this year when their son, Michael, a 17-year-old high school football player, burst into the room and made a beeline for his mom\u2019s purse. \u201cI\u2019m being blackmailed,\u201d he said. Michael had fallen prey to what online safety and law enforcement experts call financial sextortion, in which predators befriend victims online under false pretenses, entice them to send incriminating photos and then demand payment under threat that they\u2019ll expose the photos to family and friends. The number of sextortion cases targeting young people \u201chas exploded in the past couple of years,\u201d with teen boys being specific targets, said Lauren Coffren, executive director of the Exploited Children Division at the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children (NCMEC). NCMEC, which serves as a clearinghouse for records of abuse, received more than 10,000 tips of financial sextortion of minors, primarily boys, in 2022 from the public as well as from electronic service providers, such as Facebook, Instagram and Snapchat, which are required by law to report cases. By the end of July 2023, NCMEC had already received more than 12,500 reports. The repercussions of the abuse are devastating: At least a dozen boys died by suicide in 2022, after they were blackmailed, according to the FBI. Meanwhile, social media companies are playing catch up to stem the tidal wave of sextortion scams targeting children.\n\nNote: For more along these lines, see concise summaries of deeply revealing news articles on sexual abuse scandals from reliable major media sources.\n\n2023-08-29, The Intercept\n\nPosted: 2023-10-08 19:51:18\n\nThe FBI has amassed 21.7 million DNA profiles \u2014 equivalent to about 7 percent of the U.S. population \u2014 according to Bureau data reviewed by The Intercept. The FBI aims to nearly double its current $56.7 million budget for dealing with its DNA catalog with an additional $53.1 million, according to its budget request for fiscal year 2024. \u201cThe requested resources will allow the FBI to process the rapidly increasing number of DNA samples collected by the U.S. Department of Homeland Security,\u201d the appeal for an increase says. \u201cWhen we\u2019re talking about rapid expansion like this, it\u2019s getting us ever closer to a universal DNA database,\u201d Vera Eidelman, a staff attorney at the American Civil Liberties Union, [said]. \u201cI think the civil liberties implications here are significant.\u201d The rapid growth of the FBI\u2019s sample load is in large part thanks to a Trump-era rule change that mandated the collection of DNA from migrants who were arrested or detained by immigration authorities. Until recently, the U.S. DNA database surpassed even that of authoritarian China, which launched an ambitious DNA collection program in 2017. That year, the BBC reported, the U.S. had about 4 percent of its population\u2019s DNA, while China had about 3 percent. While DNA has played an important role in prosecuting crimes, less than 3 percent of the profiles have assisted in cases, the Bureau\u2019s data reveals. By comparison, fingerprints collected by the FBI from current and former federal employees linked them to crimes at a rate of 12 percent each year.\n\nNote: For more along these lines, see concise summaries of deeply revealing news articles on intelligence agency corruption and the disappearance of privacy from reliable major media sources.\n\n2023-09-27, Bloomberg\n\nPosted: 2023-10-08 19:49:22\n\nGoogle maintains one of the world\u2019s most comprehensive repositories of location information. Drawing from phones\u2019 GPS coordinates, plus connections to Wi-Fi networks and cellular towers, it can often estimate a person\u2019s whereabouts to within several feet. It gathers this information in part to sell advertising, but police routinely dip into the data to further their investigations. The use of search data is less common, but that, too, has made its way into police stations throughout the country. Traditionally, American law enforcement obtains a warrant to search the home or belongings of a specific person, in keeping with a constitutional ban on unreasonable searches and seizures. Warrants for Google\u2019s location and search data are, in some ways, the inverse of that process, says Michael Price, the litigation director for the National Association of Criminal Defense Lawyers\u2019 Fourth Amendment Center. Rather than naming a suspect, law enforcement identifies basic parameters\u2014a set of geographic coordinates or search terms\u2014and asks Google to provide hits, essentially generating a list of leads. By their very nature, these Google warrants often return information on people who haven\u2019t been suspected of a crime. In 2018 a man in Arizona was wrongly arrested for murder based on Google location data. Google says it received a record 60,472 search warrants in the US last year, more than double the number from 2019. The company provides at least some information in about 80% of cases.\n\nNote: For more along these lines, see concise summaries of deeply revealing news articles on police corruption and the disappearance of privacy from reliable major media sources.\n\n2023-10-03, The Guardian (One of the UK's Leading Newspapers)\n\nPosted: 2023-10-08 19:47:59\n\nFrom Virginia to Florida, law enforcement all over the US are increasingly using tools called reverse search warrants \u2013 including geofence location warrants and keyword search warrants \u2013 to come up with a list of suspects who may have committed particular crimes. While the former is used by law enforcement to get tech companies to identify all the devices that were near a certain place at a certain time, the latter is used to get information on everyone who\u2019s searched for a particular keyword or phrase. It\u2019s a practice public defenders, privacy advocates and many lawmakers have criticised, arguing it violates fourth amendment protections against unreasonable searches. Unlike reverse search warrants, other warrants and subpoenas target a specific person that law enforcement has established there is probable cause to believe has committed a specific crime. But geofence warrants are sweeping in nature and are often used to compile a suspect list to further investigate. Google broke out how many geofence warrants it received for the first time in 2021. The company revealed it received nearly 21,000 geofence warrants between 2018 and 2020. The tech giant did not specify how many of those requests it complied with but did share that in the second half of 2020, it responded to 82% of all government requests for data in the US with some level of information. Apple has taken steps to publish its own numbers. In the first half of 2022 the company fielded a total of 13 geofence warrants and complied with none.\n\nNote: The legal world is struggling to keep up with the rise of tech firms building ever more sophisticated means of surveilling people and their devices.

The cities of Seaside and Marina, Calif., where Fort Ord had been critical to the local economy, were left with a ghost town of clapboard barracks and decrepit, World War II-era concrete structures that neither of the cities could afford to tear down. Also left behind were poisonous stockpiles of unexploded ordnance, lead fragments, industrial solvents and explosives residue, a toxic legacy that in some areas of the base remains largely where the Army left it. Across the country, communities were promised that closed bases would be restored, cleaned up and turned over for civilian use. But the cleanup has proceeded at a snail\u2019s pace at many of the facilities, where future remediation work could extend until 2084 and local governments are struggling with the cost of making the land suitable for development. At more than 1,000 sites within the closed bases, the land is so badly contaminated that no one will ever be allowed to live on it. Sites that were supposed to be clean were later found full of asbestos, radioactivity and other health threats. Military base cleanups are often full of surprises, but Hunters Point is in a league of its own. Two former supervisors at an environmental firm, Tetra Tech EC, which the Navy hired to help clean up the base, were convicted in 2018 of fraudulently submitting clean dirt to a laboratory in place of the contaminated dirt at the shipyard.\n\nNote: For more along these lines, see concise summaries of deeply revealing news articles on military corruption from reliable major media sources.\n\n2023-09-28, The Intercept\n\nPosted: 2023-10-08 19:44:48\n\nBraven Environmental [is] a company that says it can recycle nearly 90 percent of plastic waste through a form of chemical recycling called pyrolysis. Traditional recycling is able to process only about 8.7 percent of America\u2019s plastic waste; pyrolysis uses high temperatures and low-oxygen conditions to break down the remaining plastics, like films and Styrofoam, ideally turning them into feedstock oil for new plastic production. The American Chemistry Council, the country\u2019s leading petrochemical industry trade group, claims that chemical recycling will create a \u201ccircular economy\u201d for the bulk of the world\u2019s plastic, diverting it from oceans and landfills. Plastic giants have gone so far as to dub the process \u201cadvanced recycling,\u201d but environmentalists say this is a misnomer because the majority of the plastic processed at such facilities is not recycled at all. In fact, researchers have found that the process uses more energy and has a worse overall environmental impact than virgin plastic production. Despite these challenges, lawmakers nationwide are now embracing the technology, thanks to a massive lobbying push from ... petrochemical groups. One list of warnings in a Braven air permit application reads like a toxicologist\u2019s worst nightmare: The pyrolysis oil may cause cancer and genetic defects, as well as damage to organs, fertility, and unborn children. Other hazards included being \u201cextremely flammable\u201d and \u201cvery toxic to aquatic life\u201d with \u201clong lasting effects.\u201d\n\nNote: For more along these lines, see concise summaries of deeply revealing news articles on corporate corruption from reliable major media sources.\n\n2023-07-24, The Independent (One of the UK's Leading Newspapers)\n\nPosted: 2023-10-08 19:39:58\n\nAn unknown source has been sending radio blasts towards Earth since at least 1988, scientists say. For 35 years, the source has been sending out regular 20-minute blasts of energy that vary considerably in their brightness, researchers say. The emissions appear something like the blasts that come out of pulsars or fast radio bursts, which last for milliseconds to several seconds. But the newly discovered source sends radio signals that pulsate on a period of 21 minutes \u2013 something previously thought impossible by expected explanations. Pulsars are neutron stars that spin around quickly, throwing out radio blasts as they do. When one crosses Earth, the emissions can be picked up very briefly and brightly, like being in the path of the light from a rotating lighthouse. Scientists believe that process can only work if the magnetic field of the pulsar is strong, and it is rotating quickly enough \u2013 if not, there would not be enough energy to see the pulsar from Earth. That has led to the development of the \u201cpulsar death line\u201d, which suggests that sources must be spinning fast and strong enough to be detected. The newly discovered object named GPMJ1839-10, however, is way beyond that death line. If it is a pulsar, then it seems to be operating in ways that scientists thought impossible. It could also be a highly magnetised white dwarf or magnetar, an extra kind of neutron star with incredibly strong magnetic fields. But they do not tend to send out emissions of this kind, researchers believe.\n\nNote: For more along these lines, see concise summaries of deeply revealing news articles on the mysterious nature of reality from reliable major media sources.\n\n2023-10-01, Tablet\n\nPosted: 2023-10-08 19:37:49\n\nIn March of 2021 a nonprofit group called the Center for Countering Digital Hate (CCDH) released a report about online misinformation.

The next day, China\u2019s Foreign Ministry spokesperson Mao Ning said: \"... By politicising tech and trade issues and using them as a tool and weapon, the US cannot hold back China\u2019s development but will only hurt and isolate itself when its action backfires.\" Under the Trump and Biden administrations, the US has placed hundreds of Chinese companies on trade and investment blacklists. These restrictions have banned any company in the world that uses US products \u2013 effectively every chip designer and manufacturer \u2013 from doing business with Chinese tech firms. The US has also pressured governments and firms around the world to impose similar restrictions. Washington fears that China\u2019s technological development will lead, through trade and investment, to the dispersal of advanced technologies more broadly throughout the world, namely, to states in the Global South that the US sees as a threat. This would be a significant blow to the US\u2019s power over these countries. The scale of the developments in digital technology is staggering.

It's a theory that suggests that the more contact that people have, the more willing they are to rehumanize and understand each other, even across their personal differences. It originated in the 50s with the work of Gordon Allport. After World War II, he asked himself, how can we reduce conflict in society? He put forward that, under the right conditions, having positive experiences with people of another social, ethnic, cultural, religious backgrounds could improve our tolerance and reduce our prejudice against them. 50 years later, the vast majority of studies show that it does work. If you talk about moving beyond past violence and having a harmonious society, one of the biggest things that could hamper having these contact experiences [is] the homophilia principle, where you go with your own group. It's easy to avoid having experiences with other groups. But once we do, they're very beneficial. We spoke with someone named Ali Abu Awad [who] is a Palestinian activist. He said he never had contact with an Israeli ... until he was in his 30s. And they were brought together into a group. This Israeli woman was crying, and he was crying. They were both grieving the loss of family members of the conflict. That moment of contact actually changed the whole direction of his life because he realized that this Israeli woman was human like he was. He ended up becoming an activist working toward a solution that humanizes Israelis and humanizes Palestinians at the same time.\n\nNote: This summary is a transcript of an interview with Jasper Van Assche, professor at the University of Ghent in Belgium.

The term was coined by the playwright Henrik Ibsen in his 1859 poem On the Heights, although the concept is much older. Its literal translation is \u201cfree-air life\u201d, but Ibsen used it to convey a spiritual connection with nature. To modern Norwegians, it means participating in outdoor activities, but also has a deeper sense of de-stressing in nature and sharing in a common culture. An astonishingly high percentage of Norwegians report spending time outdoors. A survey in June by the market research company Kantar TNS found that 83% are interested in friluftsliv, 77% spend time in nature on a weekly basis and 25% do so most days. At many nurseries, toddlers spend 80% of their time outside; at school, there are special days throughout the year when children go out in nature and build campfires. Studies show that being in green spaces helps reduce anxiety and improve cognition. In a 2020 survey, 90% of Norwegians said they felt less stressed and in a better mood when they spent time in nature. Helga Synnev\u00e5g L\u00f8voll, a professor of friluftsliv at Volda University College, says the five documented ways to wellbeing can be achieved through friluftsliv (they are \u201cconnect\u201d, \u201cbe active\u201d, \u201ctake notice\u201d, \u201ckeep learning\u201d and \u201cgive\u201d).

The Agence Nationale des Frequences (ANFR) said on Tuesday the model's Specific Absorption Rate (SAR) - a measure of the rate of radiofrequency energy absorbed by the body from a piece of equipment - was higher than legally allowed. Jean-Noel Barrot, France's junior minister for the digital economy, told newspaper Le Parisien a software update could fix the problem. If Apple does not resolve the issue, the ANFR said it would order a recall of the device across France. \"Specific Absorption Rate\" refers to the dose of energy that the body absorbs from any source of radiation. It is expressed as watts per kilogram of body weight. The radiation from mobile phones is a result of the way they work, by transmitting radiofrequency waves, creating electromagnetic fields. The ANFR said it recently carried out random tests on 141 phones, including iPhone 12, bought from shops. In independent laboratory tests, two iPhone 12s did not comply with EU standards, the office of the Digital Minister told Reuters. Smartphone radiation tests have so far led to 42 imposed sale stops in the country, it said. The ANFR said accredited labs had found an SAR of 5.74 watts per kilogram during tests of the iPhone 12 being held in the hand or kept in a trouser pocket.

Children were particularly hard-hit, with the poverty rate for kids doubling compared with 2021. The rise in poverty amounts to an increase of 15.3 million people around the U.S. living in poverty. Rising inflation [has] hobbled many households. Last year also marked the end of all pandemic-era benefits that helped families stay afloat during the health crisis, such as stimulus checks and the Child Tax Credit, which distributed as much as $300 per child in cash payments. The Supplemental Poverty Measure (SPM), which measures whether people have enough resources to cover their needs, was 12.4% for U.S. households in 2022, an increase of 4.6 percentage points from a year earlier, the Census said on Tuesday. The child poverty rate, as measured by the SPM, jumped from a historic low of 5.2% in 2021 to 12.4% in 2022, the Census said. That's the largest change in child poverty since the Census began tracking the SPM in 2009, Census officials said. If the expanded Child Tax Credit had been renewed, about 3 million additional children would have been kept out of poverty last year. U.S. households also earned less last year, the Census said. The median household income in 2022 was $74,580, a decline of 2.3% from 2021 and the third year in a row that incomes have dipped.\n\nNote: For more along these lines, see concise summaries of deeply revealing news articles on income inequality from reliable major media sources.\n\n2023-09-20, New York Post\n\nPosted: 2023-10-03 15:27:07\n\nA federal court of appeals ruled earlier this month that the White House, surgeon general, CDC and FBI \u201clikely violated the First Amendment\u201d by exerting a pressure campaign on social media companies to censor COVID-19 skeptics \u2014 including Stanford epidemiologist Dr. Jay Bhattacharya.

Another study, published last year in the medical journal Vaccine, estimated the rate of serious adverse events to be as high as one in 556 COVID vaccine recipients. And for young people, the incidence of myocarditis is six to 28 times higher after the vaccine than after infection, even for females, according to a 2022 JAMA Cardiology study.

Carbon farmers cultivate plants and trees in a way that maximizes carbon sequestration in the soil. Among the most important practices for carbon farmers are minimizing soil erosion by planting perennials and ground cover, which also lowers soil temperatures, and only working the land by hand or with low-tech solutions. \u201cThe soil has the capacity to store more carbon than all plants on the planet together,\u201d Alvarez says. Solidarity Farms produces a diverse range of about 60 different fruits and vegetables, at least 70 percent of them perennial crops such as plums and pomegranates. Stacks of organic chicken manure in front of the vegetable beds wait to be distributed. The farmers enrich the soil with compost and mulch, while deterring pests with diverse crop rotation. According to soil tests, the Solidarity farmers have tripled the amount of carbon in the ground since 2018. \u201cThis equates to a drawdown of nearly 600 metric tons of CO2 per year, offsetting the emissions of 80 American households,\u201d Alvarez says.\n\nNote: Have you seen the groundbreaking and inspiring movie Kiss the Ground?

Now, 60 years later, Paul Landis, one of the Secret Service agents just feet away from President John F. Kennedy on that fateful day in Dallas, is telling his story in full for the first time. His account differs from the official version. At age 88, he said, all he wants is to tell what he saw and what he did. He will leave it to everyone else to draw conclusions. What it comes down to is a copper-jacketed 6.5-millimeter projectile. The Warren Commission decided that one of the bullets fired that day struck the president from behind, exited from the front of his throat and continued on to hit Mr. Connally, somehow managing to injure his back, chest, wrist and thigh. It seemed incredible that a single bullet could do all that, so skeptics called it the magic bullet theory. Investigators came to that conclusion partly because the bullet was found on a stretcher believed to have held Mr. Connally at Parkland Memorial Hospital. In fact, [Mr. Landis] said, he was the one who found the bullet \u2014 and he found it not in the hospital near Mr. Connally but in the presidential limousine lodged in the back of the seat behind where Kennedy was sitting. \u201cIf what he says is true, which I tend to believe, it is likely to reopen the question of a second shooter, if not even more,\u201d [Historian James] Robenalt said. \u201cIf the bullet we know as the magic or pristine bullet stopped in President Kennedy\u2019s back, it means that the central thesis of the Warren Report, the single-bullet theory, is wrong.\u201d\n\nNote: For more along these lines, see concise summaries of revealing news articles on the Kennedy assassination from reliable major media sources.

The creepy collection of personal information by the two auto companies earned them failing grades from The Mozilla Foundation, maker of the Firefox web browser, which ran privacy checks on 25 car brands. The foundation said most car companies can comb through a variety of sources to glean personal information about drivers after they pair their smartphones with a vehicle\u2019s connected services. \u201cThis invasive harvesting of information is collected via a web of sensors, microphones, cameras and the phones, apps, and connected services you use in your vehicle,\u201d according to Mozilla Foundation. The car firms can then take that data and sell it to or share it with vendors, insurance companies and others. Of the 25 car brands that were reviewed, Nissan\u2019s privacy policy \u201cis probably the most ... messed up privacy policy we have ever read,\u201d according to Mozilla Foundation. \u201cThey come right out and say they can collect and share your sexual activity, health diagnosis data, and genetic information and other sensitive personal information for targeted marketing purposes,\u201d the foundation wrote. Mozilla Foundation also flagged other car companies such as Chrysler, Chevrolet, Toyota, Audi, Jeep, and Honda for \u201cbrazenly collecting deeply personal information from the moment they get into a car.\u201d\n\nNote: For more along these lines, see concise summaries of deeply revealing news articles on corporate corruption and the disappearance of privacy from reliable major media sources.\n\n2023-02-10, Wired\n\nPosted: 2023-09-18 14:16:54\n\nNew details about the FBI\u2019s failures to comply with restrictions on the use of foreign intelligence for domestic crimes have emerged. Section 702 of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA) ... grants the government the ability to intercept the electronic communications of overseas targets who are unprotected by the Fourth Amendment. That authority is set to expire at the end of the year. But errors in the FBI\u2019s secondary use of the data\u2014the investigation of crimes on US soil\u2014are likely to inflame an already fierce debate over whether law enforcement agents can be trusted with such an invasive tool. Central to this tension has been a routine audit by the Department of Justice\u2019s (DOJ) national security division and the office of the director of national intelligence (ODNI) ... which unearthed new examples of the FBI failing to comply with rules limiting access to intelligence ostensibly gathered to protect US national security. Such \u201cerrors,\u201d they said, have occurred on a \u201clarge number\u201d of occasions. A report on the audit, only recently declassified, found that in the first half of 2020, FBI personnel unlawfully searched raw FISA data on numerous occasions. In one incident, agents reportedly sought evidence of foreign influence linked to a US lawmaker. In another, an inappropriate search pertained to a local political party. In what privacy and civil liberties lawyers have termed a \u201cbackdoor search,\u201d the FBI regularly searches through unminimized data during investigations, and routinely prior to launching them.\n\nNote: For more along these lines, see concise summaries of deeply revealing news articles on intelligence agency corruption and the disappearanc", "images": ["https://www.wanttoknow.info/m/images/rss.jpg", "https://www.wanttoknow.info/m/images/menu.png", "https://www.wanttoknow.info/m/images/menu-close.png", "https://www.wanttoknow.info/m/images/social-insta.png", "https://www.wanttoknow.info/m/images/wtk-og.jpg", "https://www.wanttoknow.info/m/images/social-fb.png", "https://www.wanttoknow.info/m/images/social-twitter.png", "https://www.wanttoknow.info/m/images/fire.png", "https://forms.aweber.com/form/displays.htm?id=rAzMTEzs7Bws", "https://www.wanttoknow.info/m/images/wtk-logo.png", "https://www.wanttoknow.info/m/images/social-youtube.png"], "top_img": "https://www.wanttoknow.info/m/images/wtk-og.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": [], "canonical_link": "https://www.wanttoknow.info/newsstories-0-10000", "title": "News Stories", "meta_data": {"description": "News stories: Excerpts from highly revealing major media news stories suggest major cover-ups of health, energy, media, 9/11, war, elections, and more.

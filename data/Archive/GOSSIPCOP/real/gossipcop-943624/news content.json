She introduced the suitors to her family, but they weren't much help. Her sister told her Garrett was \u201cincredible,\u201d adding, \u201cI felt like I had known him for years.\u201d\n\nAfter meeting Blake, her sister liked him, too, saying, \u201cI feel like Blake would challenge you and he would be more of a teammate. You just need to decide what you want.\u201d\n\nFrom there, it was time for the romantic final dates in the Maldives.\n\nAt the end of their date, Garrett gushed, \u201cI know that you're the person that I need in my life to make me be a better version of myself every day, but I want to make sure that I'm the person that does that to you as well. So when you make that decision, I'm willing to be absolutely crushed at the end of this, even if it isn't me, just as long as you're happy.\u201d\n\nAfter Becca's date with Blake, it seemed she might choose him instead. She said, \u201cFor a while, I've been in love with Blake. He always surprises me. He's so good at everything. He makes me laugh, he has great conversation, he stimulates me, he's romantic. He's really everything I could want in a partner.\u201d\n\nBefore the breakup and proposal, Becca took a moment to explain where she's coming from, \u201cI feel like I could be happy with either guy and both of them would be a right choice for me. But I'm going for the one that I can't see myself without. This love feels like it just fits my soul, it just fits my heart.\u201d\n\nWhen it was time for the breakup, Becca let Blake down as gently as she could.\n\nShe told him, \u201cYou have been the most solid, constant relationship and one that I could turn to anytime. I knew that you'd be there and you'd be a partner to me \u2014 and a teammate. You've made me know that I can fall in love again.\u201d\n\nBecca goes on to tell him, \u201cI think that there's just a better fit for us out there.\u201d\n\nBlake was devastated and speechless for a moment. He told her he loves her and that she's making a mistake, before admitting he knew this was how it would end.\n\nThe show ended with the moment fans had been waiting for\u2026 the proposal!\n\nWhen Garrett joined Becca on the beach she told him, \u201cYou got that first impression rose because right away I felt something so strong. I re-read my journal and you were the first guy I ever wrote about in it. I wrote that you reminded me of home, and you reminded me one of the most important men in my life entire life and that was my dad.\u201d\n\nAfter she professed her love for Garrett, he popped the question, and she said yes!\n\nBecca and Garrett have been making headlines for months. In May, TMZ posted photos of Becca kissing a man that bore a strong resemblance to Garrett.\n\nHe also sparked controversy over his questionable likes on Instagram. The proposal took place before those social media likes came to light.\n\nOf the backlash surrounding Garrett, Becca told \u201cExtra\u201d in May, \u201cEveryone has an opinion \u2014 that's what is so great about our country. People are entitled to their own beliefs.\u201d\n\nShe continued, \u201cThat being said, I want to go through that entire journey with people \u2013 open to me and open to all the 28 men\u2026 I hope that after watching the entire season play out, they can stay open and get to know the guys for who they are.\u201d", "images": ["https://extra-images.akamaized.net/image/55/5by6/2023/09/29/558391e278e3424fad3e70b54461b5b0_sm.jpg", "https://extra-images.akamaized.net/image/d1/5by6/2023/10/16/d12575d1092c45e1a0d9f440fc1a360c_md.jpg", "https://extra-images.akamaized.net/image/9d/16by9/2018/08/06/9d743f67601c5624ae8a56ebdc2ed518_xl.jpg", "https://extra-images.akamaized.net/image/b9/4by3/2023/10/14/b9196350a5d84efbb0b6d239be59d37a_sm.jpg", "https://extra-images.akamaized.net/image/09/4by3/2023/10/15/09df764aee72400697a95fa62e63878b_sm.png", "https://extra-images.akamaized.net/image/73/5by6/2023/10/02/7322cbbcd4ff434c8686d551c34d0e17_sm.jpg", "https://extra-images.akamaized.net/image/78/5by6/2023/10/12/78afc7b201e64313b36fee3176b17363_sm.jpg", "https://extra-images.akamaized.net/image/71/3by2/2018/08/06/714b19f5489d58e4be53e66374425d1e_xs.jpg", "https://static.extratv.com/extra-web/img/logos/extra-logo-v2.png", "https://extra-images.akamaized.net/image/1e/5by6/2023/10/02/1e6acf85c7524c9aa141b1f3a3e81a3e_sm.jpg", "https://extra-images.akamaized.net/image/71/3by2/2018/08/06/71ff13f7cce35c768906ff93497c6859_md.jpg", "https://extra-images.akamaized.net/image/d1/4by3/2023/10/16/d12575d1092c45e1a0d9f440fc1a360c_sm.jpg", "https://extra-images.akamaized.net/image/60/5by4/2018/06/04/609fe2f37be25b9fbfe6da9a27634fc7_xs.jpg", "https://extra-images.akamaized.net/image/7f/5by6/2023/09/29/7fd9c328d08d45f0a015b4a454b3c037_sm.jpg", "https://extra-images.akamaized.net/image/79/3by2/2018/07/24/79d8942a1bbd5f58bade22a48aa2934e_xs.jpg", "https://extra-images.akamaized.net/image/92/3by2/2018/07/30/9212bd7c5e285526a75c13e016ee00ee_xs.jpg", "https://extra-images.akamaized.net/image/73/3by2/2023/09/22/73d8500c496c4523b3b1e9862a8fe3fa_md.jpg", "https://extra-images.akamaized.net/image/5e/4by3/2023/10/12/5eef5c84d88844f68d924272243ecde8_sm.jpg", "https://extra-images.akamaized.net/image/c1/5by6/2023/10/10/c1a9c7c008b8493d92796cca8d87fd32_md.png", "https://extra-images.akamaized.net/image/a4/5by6/2023/10/13/a4554d210ed54aa4bc411c3c311407b7_sm.jpg"], "top_img": "https://extra-images.akamaized.net/image/9d/16by9/2018/08/06/9d743f67601c5624ae8a56ebdc2ed518_xl.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": [], "canonical_link": "https://extratv.com/2018/08/06/the-bachelorette-finale-who-did-becca-kufrin-choose/", "title": "'The Bachelorette' Finale: Who Did Becca Kufrin Choose?", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "referrer": "unsafe-url", "google-site-verification": "google56b059efc05e54d5.html", "facebook-domain-verification": "44qronxuhsbneeks26nb04sp0hwv89", "robots": "index,follow", "description": "Becca Kufrin has found the one!", "fb": {"app_id": 18489729593, "pages": 26676834754}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/Extra/"}, "og": {"site_name": "Extra", "type": "article", "url": "https://extratv.com/2018/08/06/the-bachelorette-finale-who-did-becca-kufrin-choose/", "title": "'The Bachelorette' Finale: Who Did Becca Kufrin Choose?", "description": "Becca Kufrin has found the one!", "image": "https://extra-images.akamaized.net/image/9d/16by9/2018/08/06/9d743f67601c5624ae8a56ebdc2ed518_xl.jpg"}, "twitter": {"site": "@extratv", "card": "summary_large_image", "title": "'The Bachelorette' Finale: Who Did Becca Kufrin Choose?", "description": "Becca Kufrin has found the one!", "image": "https://extra-images.akamaized.net/image/9d/16by9/2018/08/06/9d743f67601c5624ae8a56ebdc2ed518_xl.jpg"}, "apple-mobile-web-app-capable": "yes", "apple-mobile-web-app-status-bar-style": "#0b1d2e", "apple-mobile-web-app-title": "extratv.com", "application-name": "extratv.com", "mobile-web-app-capable": "yes", "theme-color": "#0b1d2e", "msapplication-TileImage": "https://static.extratv.com/extra-web/icons/msapplication-tile-image-310x310-v1.png", "msapplication-TileColor": "#0b1d2e", "msapplication-starturl": "https://extratv.com/?adid=IE9pin", "msapplication-navbutton-color": "#0b1d2e", "msapplication-window": "width=1024;height=768", "msapplication-tooltip": "Extra", "msapplication-task": "name=Photos;action-uri=https://extratv.com/photos/;icon-uri=https://static.extratv.com/extra-web/icons/favicon-32x32-v1.png"}, "movies": ["https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/?listType=playlist&list=PLmZGUEYglL9tWKCaerqrPWA-yC8mum6S1"], "publish_date": 1533484800.0, "source": "http://extratv.com", "summary": ""}

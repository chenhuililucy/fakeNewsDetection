Bernie Sanders\u2019 2016 Democratic presidential campaign.\n\nWoodley brought up the possible run in an interview with The New York Times.\n\n\u201cThere was a point last year when I was working for Bernie Sanders where I thought, \u2018Huh, maybe I\u2019ll run for Congress in a couple years.' And you know what? I\u2019m not going rule it out. Who knows? Life is big, and I\u2019m young.\u201d\n\nKID ROCK FOR SENATE? A LOOK AT THE MUSICIAN'S POLITICAL PAST\n\nWoodley is not the first star to come forward and mull the potential of running. Singer Kid Rock has teased his 2018 run for a seat in the Senate representing Michigan. Dwayne \u201cThe Rock\u201d Johnson has been rumored to be considering running for president in 2020.\n\nWoodley has been an outspoken environmental activist and was arrested last October while protesting the Dakota Access Pipeline in North Dakota. She was accused of trespassing. Woodley pleaded guilty to disorderly conduct and was sentenced to \u201cone year deferred imposition of sentence and one year of unsupervised probation,\u201d according to Entertainment Weekly.\n\nWoodley, who is celebrating her Emmy nomination from her role in HBO\u2019s \u201cBig Little Lies\u201d also spoke about feminism in the interview, a topic she has been vocal about in the past.\n\nJILL STEIN PLEADS GUILTY IN PIPELINE PROTEST\n\n\u201cI would today consider myself a feminist,\u201d Woodley said. \u201cIf females start working through the false narrative of jealousy and insecurity fed through a patriarchal society, then not only will we have more women feeling confident in themselves and supportive of one another, but we will start introducing a type of matriarchy, which is what this world needs. We need more softness and more silence and more pause through the chaos.\u201d", "images": ["https://a57.foxnews.com/static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2023/10/348/196/vanna-white-and-daughter.jpg?ve=1&tl=1", "https://a57.foxnews.com/static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2018/09/1200/675/shailene3.jpg?ve=1&tl=1", "https://a57.foxnews.com/cf-images.us-east-1.prod.boltdns.net/v1/static/694940094001/56f75766-2ae6-46f0-8b36-d4ec08d4f346/6e61e3c8-3df5-4d18-80b9-c31a935bdf97/1280x720/match/348/196/image.jpg?ve=1&tl=1", "https://a57.foxnews.com/static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2023/10/348/196/kelly-clarkson.jpg?ve=1&tl=1", "https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2022/11/NEWSLETTER_ENT-532x120.png", "https://a57.foxnews.com/static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2023/10/348/196/maren-morris-divorce-ryan-hurd.jpg?ve=1&tl=1", "https://a57.foxnews.com/static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2018/09/1200/675/6e73dc33-shailene.jpg?ve=1&tl=1", "https://a57.foxnews.com/static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2018/09/1200/675/shailene2.jpg?ve=1&tl=1", "https://a57.foxnews.com/cf-images.us-east-1.prod.boltdns.net/v1/static/694940094001/9765f6fe-3ab3-4829-95e4-e1c5ae9a2dd1/d34b1dee-e0be-414f-98b4-53783e2e3172/1280x720/match/348/196/image.jpg?ve=1&tl=1", "https://a57.foxnews.com/cf-images.us-east-1.prod.boltdns.net/v1/static/694940094001/271ebf0b-eced-4c50-803a-4cc67ddbda1e/27ef136b-1144-449c-8b9f-643d36adbbe8/1280x720/match/348/196/image.jpg?ve=1&tl=1", "https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2018/09/shailene2.jpg"], "top_img": "https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2018/09/shailene2.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Kathleen Joyce"], "canonical_link": "https://www.foxnews.com/entertainment/shailene-woodley-considers-future-run-for-congress", "title": "Shailene Woodley considers future run for Congress", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, minimum-scale=1.0, initial-scale=1.0", "msapplication-square70x70logo": "//static.foxnews.com/static/orion/styles/img/fox-news/favicons/mstile-70x70.png", "msapplication-square150x150logo": "//static.foxnews.com/static/orion/styles/img/fox-news/favicons/mstile-150x150.png", "msapplication-square310x310logo": "//static.foxnews.com/static/orion/styles/img/fox-news/favicons/mstile-310x310.png", "msapplication-wide310x150logo": "//static.foxnews.com/static/orion/styles/img/fox-news/favicons/mstile-310x150.png", "description": "\u201cBig Little Lies\u201d star Shailene Woodley said in an interview that she had thought about running for Congress following last year\u2019s election in which she supported Sen.

And I went up to her and I was like, you know, tapped her. And she was so friendly and nice, I wasn't expecting that, and she was like 'Hey girl, good to see you!' And I was like 'Uh...oh...we're, uh...' and just excused myself and walked away. So any chance that we had to be best friends, I ruined it with my drunken nervousness, starstruck-ness.\"\n\nThis likely won't be the last time the two cross paths though since Rae is supposed to be writing a Twitter-conceived heist film starring Lupita Nyong'o and Rihanna. In the meantime, the two definitely have at least one thing in common\u2014they've both been pursued by Drake. While RiRi made it clear she's not interested in the Toronto rapper, Rae once again stated she did not turn him down at the Golden Globes.\n\n\"I was heading to the HBO party, as I should, and he [Drake] was leaving the HBO party. And so we crossed paths and he said the most magical words ever. He was like 'I've been looking for you all night.' And I was like 'You talking about me?' And he was like 'I'm about to go to this Netflix party, do you want to go?' And I was like 'Oh I have to go stop in the HBO party' because they're the network that puts my show on, I couldn't just ditch the party and go to Netflix party even though that's what I really wanted to do. So I was like 'I'll catch you at that party.' That was it. Then I went to the party and all of a sudden blogs were reporting that I turned him down which would never happen.\"\n\nLuckily, that didn't stop Rae from turning up in Drake's \"Nice for What\" video alongside a ton of other famous women, which she called it a \"dream come true.\"\n\nAs for her critically-acclaimed HBO series Insecure, Rae told Colbert her mom stopped watching after a few racy scenes in season 2. Season 3 is slated to begin this Sunday at 10:30 p.m. with undoubtedly more scenes for Rae's mom to frown at.", "images": ["https://img.buzzfeed.com/buzzfeed-static/static/2023-10/16/15/campaign_images/957c07930f3f/the-20-best-rick-and-morty-episodes-so-far-3-583-1697469493-12_16x9.jpg?output-quality=auto&fill=3840:2160;center,top", "https://img.buzzfeed.com/buzzfeed-static/static/user_images/DeTG08aBE_large.jpg?output-format=jpg", "https://cdn.jwplayer.com/v2/media/elb2yz5j/poster.jpg?width=720", "https://img.buzzfeed.com/buzzfeed-static/static/2023-10/16/14/campaign_images/c56a2083be8b/how-kendall-hurns-creative-journey-began-as-par-8-3-450-1697466886-0_16x9.jpg?output-quality=auto&fill=3840:2160;center,top", "https://img.buzzfeed.com/buzzfeed-static/static/2023-10/17/1/campaign_images/fa0f1d16422f/the-internet-reacts-to-bobbi-althoff-interviewing-3-722-1697506698-0_16x9.jpg?output-quality=auto&fill=3840:2160;center,top", "https://img.buzzfeed.com/buzzfeed-static/static/2023-10/17/13/campaign_images/094f4161b16b/everything-you-need-to-know-about-killers-of-the--3-1061-1697549987-0_16x9.jpg?output-quality=auto&fill=3840:2160;center,top", "https://img.buzzfeed.com/buzzfeed-static/static/2022-12/7/23/tmp/ea18a8e4c147/tmp-name-3-1036-1670456862-79_dblbig.jpg", "https://img.buzzfeed.com/buzzfeed-static/static/2023-10/15/23/campaign_images/e57c4c666acd/50-cent-responds-to-jada-pinkett-smith-admitting--3-6608-1697410801-0_16x9.jpg?output-quality=auto&fill=3840:2160;center,top", "data:image/png;base64,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", "https://img.buzzfeed.com/buzzfeed-static/static/2023-10/16/15/campaign_images/07d98b1f186f/spider-man-2-doesnt-swing-to-new-heights-but-it-d-3-421-1697471824-19_16x9.jpg?output-quality=auto&fill=3840:2160;center,top", "https://img.buzzfeed.com/buzzfeed-static/static/2023-10/16/15/campaign_images/957c07930f3f/stephen-a-smith-calls-out-jada-pinkett-smith-over-3-705-1697471896-0_16x9.jpg?output-quality=auto&fill=3840:2160;center,top", "https://img.buzzfeed.com/buzzfeed-static/static/2023-10/16/13/campaign_images/a7a26b0011c9/halle-berry-was-allegedly-tricked-into-acting-in--3-9704-1697462761-1_16x9.jpg?output-quality=auto&fill=3840:2160;center,top", "https://cdn.jwplayer.com/v2/media/D1i76lza/poster.jpg?width=320", "data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7", "https://img.buzzfeed.com/buzzfeed-static/static/2023-10/11/17/user_images/cb554cc2f25d/jameel-raeburn-v2-1345-1697044133-4_large.png", "https://img.buzzfeed.com/buzzfeed-static/static/2023-10/16/17/campaign_images/6dffec384b08/jim-jones-asks-for-proof-of-jada-pinkett-smiths-d-3-998-1697477592-0_16x9.jpg?output-quality=auto&fill=3840:2160;center,top"], "top_img": "https://img.buzzfeed.com/buzzfeed-static/static/2022-12/7/23/tmp/ea18a8e4c147/tmp-name-3-1036-1670456862-79_dblbig.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Victoria L.

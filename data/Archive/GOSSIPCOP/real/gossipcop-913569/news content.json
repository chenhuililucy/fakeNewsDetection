Khloe\u2019s gonna die. She\u2019s literally going to go into labour over this\u201d.\n\nThough none of the sisters are together when the news breaks, they share messages with each other to piece together what\u2019s happened.\n\nKendall, who is in the car with Scott Disick when she finds out, reads aloud one of the allegations about the NBA star: \u201cThe woman who filmed the clip said, \u2018I was there and he was on the table right next to us with a group of friends and everybody watched them make out several times.'\n\n\u201cI\u2019m in shock right now. I don\u2019t even know what to say,\u201d Kendall continues. \u201cLike, what a f*cking idiot. It\u2019s a sick joke.\u201d\n\nIt's then revealed that Kylie texted Khloe the article, but she's not responding to any of her sister's messages.\n\n\"No one had the courage to tell Khlo\u00e9 because we knew she was days away from giving birth. We didn't want to stress her out, but we knew it was the right thing to do, so I'm the one who told Khlo\u00e9,\" Kylie admits.\n\n\u201cI didn\u2019t want to hurt her feelings, but I felt like she should hear from one of us versus on the internet,\u201d she adds.\n\nThe clip ends rather dramatically when Kim answers the phone to Khloe\u2019s best friend Malika, who simply says, \u201cWhat the f*ck is that?!\u201d\n\nWoah, that's intense.\n\nThe episode was filmed in April when the cheating news broke. Khloe then went into labour and gave birth to True two days later. Fast forward to November and fans still aren\u2019t sure if Khlo\u00e9 and Tristan's relationship has recovered from the scandal.\n\nInstagram Stories/Tristan Thompson\n\nTristan shared his first ever family selfie on Halloween, but a recent People source says Khloe has been having a \u201creally tough\u201d time and \u201cstill has a lot of hurt and anger\u201d.\n\n\n\nThe 34-year-old has also admitted that the whole thing is \u201chard to relive\u201d, so something tells me she\u2019s going to avoid watching this episode.\n\nRelated Story A pro face reader assesses Khloe and Tristan",

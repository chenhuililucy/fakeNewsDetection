Over a decade. Love y'all!\n\nDuring the concert, Beyonc\u00e9 was also spotted cutting some shapes to Missy's gig alongside Icelandic singer Bj\u00f6rk, wearing round sunglasses and a mint-green jacket.\n\nQueen Bee's night out comes several weeks after she was photographed with her husband at rapper Vic Mensa's debut album The Autobiography listening party in Los Angeles, a night before her twins' debut to Instagram.\n\nIf only we had Beyonc\u00e9's energy this morning!\n\nRelated Story Beyonc\u00e9 Fans Are Not Happy With Her New Wax Figure\n\nRelated Story The Beyonc\u00e9 Backlash Is an Insult to

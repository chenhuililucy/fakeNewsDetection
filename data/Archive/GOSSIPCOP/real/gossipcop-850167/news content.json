Listen ? https://t.co/48RuyAdouO #HarryStylesListeningParty pic.twitter.com/dZfv2uRtKI \u2014 BBC Radio 1 (@BBCR1) May 12, 2017\n\nHarry Styles solo debut album has finally made its way out into the world today. The suite of 10 songs has made a pretty positive impact with fans and critics alike, but many people seem to be focusing on one song in particular, the fourth track, \u201cTwo Ghosts.\u201d Some of Styles more observant fans have already pored over the lyrics and seem convinced that the song is about his one-time love interest Taylor Swift. The singer himself was recently confronted with the theory while a guest on BBC 1, which made him noticeably uncomfortable.\n\n\u201cHelp me Jeffrey,\u201d Styles implored to someone off set after being asked about the song. When pressed, Styles said that the content of the song was \u201cpretty self-explanatory,\u201d while adding, \u201cIt\u2019s about, sometimes things change, and you can do all the same things, and sometimes it\u2019s just different.\u201d The host pointed out that the explanation was a \u201cRound about the houses answer,\u201d to which Styles only replied, \u201c2017. Philosopher. London.\u201d\n\nAt the heart of the speculation about T-Swift is the lyrics in the song that read, \u201cSame lips, red / Same eyes, blue / Same white shirt, couple more tattoos.\u201d And then, \u201cBut it\u2019s not you and it\u2019s not me / Tastes so sweet, looks so real / Sounds like something that I used to feel / But I can\u2019t touch what I see / We\u2019re not who we used to be / We\u2019re not who we used to be / We\u2019re just two ghosts singing in the\u2026\u201d\n\nWhat do you think? Is \u201cTwo Ghosts\u201d really about Taylor Swift?", "images": ["https://uproxx.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/monaleo-uproxx-sessions.jpeg?w=241&h=136&crop=1",

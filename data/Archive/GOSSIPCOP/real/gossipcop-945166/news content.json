Initially set for release at the end of 2015, Ctrl experienced not one, but two setbacks before it finally dropped on June 9, 2017. Now, all the hard work has paid off because the RIAA revealed on Thursday that the album has officially gone platinum.\n\nFully aware that you only get one debut album, SZA admits that she was incredibly particular about which songs made the final cut. \u201cI freestyle everything, all the way down,\u201d she toldThe Guardian. \u201cAnd I listen back and think, what\u2019s shitty? And if something\u2019s too shitty and I can\u2019t put my finger on it, and I think, wow this sucks to me, then I get way frustrated, and usually scrap the song. I just kept fucking everything up. I just kept moving shit around. I was choosing from 150, 200 songs, so I\u2019m just like, who knows what\u2019s good any more?\u201d SZA says the final product only came about when the record company took her hard drive.\n\nCtrl was nominated at this year\u2019s Grammys for Best Urban Contemporary Album, and the 27-year-old singer received a Best New Artist nom of her own. Before the album was released, SZA grew incredibly frustrated with her situation with her label Top Dawg Entertainment that she briefly quit, telling TDE co-president Terrence \"Punch\" Henderson to release the project \u201cif he ever feels like it\u201d in a tweet that has since deleted. All that is now water under the bridge and Punch was one of the first people to congratulate SZA on her latest achievement.", "images":

Yet, it\u2019s such a simple step \u2013 nestling neatly between your toner and moisturiser, these potent formulas do so much more than a regular moisturiser.\n\nGiven the strength and density of the crucial ingredients in their make-up, they can perform skin-saving miracles \u2013 targeting fine lines, wrinkles, hyperpigmentation, dark spots and dullness \u2013 to ultimately achieve a more youthful look.\n\nYou\u2019ll want to look for serums with ingredients rich in vitamins, minerals and antioxidants. Serums with these tend to offer a more natural attempt at plumping, firming, and stimulating collagen production. It\u2019s also worth looking out for green tea, berries and marine-inspired skincare.\n\nWe also recommend using products that contain hyaluronic acid and retinol. The former not only hydrates the skin but simultaneously adds a smoothing and plumping effect, while the latter is considered the best anti-ageing ingredient around.\n\nRetinol gets to work on the surface of the skin, focusing on skintone and texture, as well as going deeper and stimulating cell renewal. However, exercise caution, as those with sensitive or dry skin might find this causes irritation or flakiness.\n\nYou should also pay close attention to the texture of your serum. The lighter and faster to absorb it is, the easier it will be to add into your skincare routine. Plus, for those who have sensitive or oily skin, having a lighter-weight serum will definitely be a bonus, as you\u2019ll want to minimise the feeling of the products you\u2019re piling on your face.\n\nStill, with so many brands putting their best foot forward, it\u2019s hard to know which is the best. So, we\u2019ve narrowed it down to our top picks, taking into account the different skincare anti-ageing concerns that each serum addressed.\n\nThe best anti-ageing serums for 2023 are:", "images": ["https://static.independent.co.uk/2021/04/08/17/Anti%20ageing%20serums%20indybest.jpg", "https://static.independent.co.uk/2021/04/08/17/Anti%20ageing%20serums%20indybest.jpg?quality=75&width=1200&auto=webp"], "top_img": "https://static.independent.co.uk/2021/04/08/17/Anti%20ageing%20serums%20indybest.jpg?quality=75&width=1200&auto=webp", "keywords": [], "authors": [], "canonical_link": "https://www.independent.co.uk/extras/indybest/fashion-beauty/skincare/best-anti-aging-serum-uk-a9419156.html", "title": "Best anti-ageing serum 2023: For wrinkles and fine lines", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no, minimum-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0", "description": "Whether you\u2019re 50, 40 or any age, get your skin looking youthful with these best anti-ageing serums from Charlotte Tilbury, Est\u00e9e Lauder, Elemis and more", "amp-google-client-id-api": "googleanalytics", "robots": "max-image-preview:large,max-video-preview:-1", "fb": {"app_id": 235586169789578, "pages": "https://www.facebook.com/TheIndependentOnline"}, "category": "Skincare", "sitename": "The Independent", "page path": "/extras/indybest/fashion-beauty/skincare", "page type": "Article", "adPageType": "Article Page", "og": {"locale": "en_GB", "updated_time": "2023-05-31T11:21:45.000Z", "site_name": "The Independent", "title": "Anti-ageing serums that target wrinkles, dark spots and dullness", "url": "https://www.independent.co.uk/extras/indybest/fashion-beauty/skincare/best-anti-aging-serum-uk-a9419156.html", "type": "article", "description": "These products will be the superheroes of your skincare routine", "image": {"identifier": "https://static.independent.co.uk/2021/04/08/17/Anti%20ageing%20serums%20indybest.jpg?quality=75&width=1200&auto=webp", "secure_url": "https://static.independent.co.uk/2021/04/08/17/Anti%20ageing%20serums%20indybest.jpg?quality=75&width=1200&auto=webp"}}, "article": {"published_time": "2023-05-31T11:21:45.000Z", "modified_time": "2023-05-31T11:21:45.000Z", "section": "Extras", "subsection": "IndyBest", "author_name": "Amira Arasteh", "content_type": "story", "word_count": 386, "image_count": 1, "embed_count": 1, "video_count": 0, "internal_link_count": 3, "external_link_count": 0}, "date": "2023-05-31T11:21:45.000Z", "theme-color": "#f7f7f7", "google-signin-client_id": "329250492844-uqochn2f1j5ljkshuap5gc7qphf1refj.apps.googleusercontent.com", "twitter": {"title": "Anti-ageing serums that target wrinkles, dark spots and dullness", "site": "@Independent", "card": "summary_large_image", "description": "These products will be the superheroes of your skincare routine", "image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/2021/04/08/17/Anti%20ageing%20serums%20indybest.jpg?quality=75&width=1200&auto=webp"}, "keywords": "anti ageing,indybest,Internal", "amp-script-src": "sha384-NKvx4GvveYZx73ZMBpdl8uU0zYehKtK88NUEU9mB7sYHj6KwkyQyL87eSxJD_e99 sha384-Kp4k6oTIGHeMp5uCHKzfng5fxDzkWlGrib75ZryRFC91i01dklhYZ9V5kAkSR_wq"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1685532105.0, "source": "https://www.independent.co.uk", "summary": ""}

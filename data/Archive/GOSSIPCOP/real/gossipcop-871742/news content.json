And after you think Sonja, you probably picture her, glass of wine in hand, the life of the party.\n\nThat was exactly the setting in which I met her at the opening of the new TMPL gym location. Morgan, dressed in head-to-toe sequins, was the center of attention, people hanging on her every word. Luckily, I was able to steal her away for a few minutes to talk her holiday favorites, the new season of RHONY, and which co-star would get coal from her this year.\n\nFinish this sentence for us: For Sonja, it\u2019s not the holidays without\u2026\n\nMore From Town & Country\n\nWithout real cranberry sauce. Right? And also Sonja Morgan designs!\n\nAre you excited for your fashion line in 2019?\n\nOh, great stuff for the fashion line\u2014I\u2019m teaming up with Susanne Bartsch because I love her and her dedication to supporting AIDS research, which I also have been an advocate for. And for the show, season ten is amazing. [At this point, Morgan steps away from the interview for a few seconds to tell a drag queen walking by that she looks great, and that she is a Sagittarius, which felt like the most Sonja Morgan moment ever.]\n\n\n\nAre you still vegan?\n\nLast year, season nine, I was trying to be vegan and people said no you\u2019re vegetarian darling 'cause you wear leather and I was crushed. I was eating oysters and I thought those were vegan cause they were raw\u2014no, no, no. I learned a lot\u2014so I'm vegetarian but once in a while I\u2019ll have a hamburger or hot dog. Everything in moderation!\n\nYou\u2019ve been very philanthropic throughout past seasons. What inspired you to be involved with the toy drive this year?\n\nIt\u2019s such a great cause! I brought three bags of toys: eight barbies, three footballs, three magic eight balls.\n\nSince we\u2019re at the David Barton and Susanne Bartsch\u2019s Toy Drive, was there a toy you got as a kid that was your favorite?\n\nYou could never have enough stuffed animals!\n\nIf you had to give one of your co-stars coal for Christmas, which one would it be?\n\nOh I\u2019d love to do that to Ramona because I love her and she\u2019d get such a kick out of it.\n\nWhat is the best thing you learned about yourself from filming?\n\nWell every year I learn to not take myself seriously and that you have to laugh at yourself.\n\nRelated Story A Real Housewives of NYC Social Clout Ranking\n\nRelated Story The Forgotten Real Housewives of New York", "images":

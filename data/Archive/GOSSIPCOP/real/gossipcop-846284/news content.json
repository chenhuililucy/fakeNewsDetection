She is unable to attend the ceremony at St. Mark's church in Engelfield, England, however, as protocol prohibits unmarried and un-engaged partners to be present at the nuptials.\n\n\n\nWATCH: Meghan Markle to Attend Pippa Middleton's Wedding With Prince Harry\n\nWe also know that the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge's children will play a big part in the wedding.

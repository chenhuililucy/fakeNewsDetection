Before the big day comes promposals, which can be intimidating \u2014 especially when you don't know which way it's going to go. Fear, however, did not stop a Burger King in Lynn, Massachusetts from asking the Wendy's next door (very publicly) to prom via a storefront sign.\n\n\u201c@WENDYS PROM?\u201d Burger King's marquee read.\n\nThis content is imported from twitter.

This time though, the red head spared BK and agreed to go \u2014 under a few conditions.\n\nMore From Delish\n\n\u201cOK, but don\u2019t get handsy and we have to be home by 10,\u201d Wendy\u2019s tweeted.\n\nThis content is imported from twitter.

Seizing the opportunity to get in on the viral moment, they responded with a hinge of playful jealousy for not asking Wendy's first.\n\n\n\nThis content is imported from twitter.

Wendy's threw a couple quick jabs at McDonald's via Twitter.\n\nThis content is imported from twitter.

I need one more banana pic.twitter.com/DBqKjQpSM7 \u2014 christine teigen (@chrissyteigen) September 21, 2017\n\nShe tweeted a guy called Jake who she had been in touch with earlier that day.

September 22, 2017\n\nThankfully, Chrissy then had enough bananas to continue with her banana bread.\n\nShe expressed her gratitude for the help Twitter had given her.\n\nShe then posted a couple of videos of the finished banana bread.\n\nAnd, to be fair to her, it does look pretty unreal.\n\nFair play, Chrissy.", "images": ["https://her.ie/uploads/2014/02/gy.png?height=116&width=116&cropped",

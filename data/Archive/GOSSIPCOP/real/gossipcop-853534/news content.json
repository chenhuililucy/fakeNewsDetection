Your classic prince charming.'\n\nScroll down for video\n\nUnlikely friends: Taylor Swift was introduced to her 'charismatic' new man by close friend Emma Stone, who is currently filming in Britain with the actor\n\nOne of the boys: British hearthrob Alwyn, 26, pictured at a football tournament, is an upcoming star who still lives with his mother and father in London\n\nNew romance: Swift is reportedly dating little known British actor Joe Alwyn, best known for his titular role in celebrated directer Ang Lee's 2016 film Billy Lynn's Long Halftime Walk\n\nPrince charming: Privately educated Joe Alwyn, 26, pictured left at a fancy dress party during his university days, has been secretly dating Taylor Swift for several months, it is reported\n\n'Women want to throw themselves at him. It's the way he holds himself. But to a certain extent he was married to his work. He caught the eye of certain people in our class until they realised he was so married to his work.\n\nMr Bunton-Williams, an actor and writer who is creating a film about Mardoche Yembi a man accused of being a child witch, added: 'He's very hardworking, very down to earth, very diligent and very gregarious. A very nice spirit to be around.\n\n'The whole class was close and formed a real bond, I texted him well done after his last film and he replied to say thanks.'\n\nSwift has reportedly been flying to London to see her new boyfriend where she has walked around in disguise to avoid being recognised. The star has even rented a property close to his parents.\n\nA source said: 'She's been walking around with Joe in London using disguises, like scarves and hats, to keep her identity under wraps. Nobody has a clue they've been walked past a music superstar \u2013 not even her new neighbours.\n\n'This isn't a new couple alert or a secret relationship \u2013 the only people this has been a secret to is the media because all of us, Taylor and Joe's closest friends and their families, were aware they have been together for several months and have known each other for a long time.\n\n'After her 1989 tour and all the attention Taylor received, she learned she had to be more protective of her personal life and she and Joe decided early on to keep their private life private.'\n\nPopular: Former classmate Jordan Bunton-Williams said: 'He's very charismatic, he's what I refer to as a quintessential panty-dropper. Your classic prince charming'\n\nRising star: Alwyn was educated at the fee-paying City of London School and attended the National Youth Theatre in Holloway, north London\n\nHeartthrob: A friend told MailOnline Alwyn was a heartthrob while at drama school but never had a girlfriend because he was so committed to his craft\n\nReports suggest that Miss Swift has put Alwyn up in a luxury rental home in London.\n\nA source told The Sun: \u2018Taylor and Joe are the real deal, this is a very serious relationship.\u2019\n\nAlwyn was born on February 21 1991 to a psychotherapist mother and documentary-maker father and grew up in Crouch End, north London.\n\nHis paternal grandfather was the successful British composer William Alwyn, famous for the opera The Fairy Fiddler.\n\nJust weeks after they met, Taylor reportedly took her mother Andrea and friends Este and Alana from the band Haim, to the cinema to see Alwyn in the film Long Halftime Walk.\n\nHe was educated at the fee-paying City of London School and attended the National Youth Theatre in Holloway, north London.\n\nThe actor later enrolled at the University of Bristol and studied there until 2012 before going on to London's Royal Central School of Speech and Drama.\n\nAlwyn read English and drama at Bristol and has two younger brothers, Patrick and Thomas and now works at a charity called international alert in Clapham, south west London.\n\nHe has now joined an illustrious list of boyfriends who have dated the famous singer, including Jake Gyllenhall, Joe Jonas, Harry Styles, Calvin Harris, John Mayer and Tom Hiddleston.\n\nParties: Alwyn, pictured at a fancy dress party during his time at University of Bristol where he studied English and Drama, was a committed and ambitious student, friends have said\n\nUnder the radar: As Alwyn joins an intimidating list of boyfriends that already includes Jake Gyllenhaal, Harry Styles, John Mayer and Tom Hiddleston, exactly how does he line up?\n\nKeeping close: Joe still lives with his parents at a \u00a31.3million house in North London - and Taylor has reportedly rented a house nearby, where Joe is said to be a frequent guest\n\nAlwyn\u2019s grandfather Jonathan yesterday said he had not been told about Miss Swift. He said: \u2018He kept very quiet about it as far as I\u2019m concerned.\n\n\u2018I know he was in LA making a film for Ang Lee, which, alas, was not a very good film, but he got very nice notices for it and he\u2019s just been in The Sense of an Ending. I\u2019m sure he\u2019s had girlfriends but I have no idea.\u2019\n\nHis parents, documentary-maker Richard and psychotherapist Elizabeth, declined to comment yesterday.\n\nRecalling his former student, Nick Moseley, the RCSSD's principal lecturer, said: 'He has a disarming humility which appears both on and off screen.\n\n'I spoke to Joe recently and found that the experience of starring in a Hollywood movie had not changed him at all. He will continue to be the person he is.'\n\nGeoffrey Colman, head of acting at the Central School for Speech and Drama, said: 'Joe was always deeply committed to his craft. He was often very moved by the massiveness of his vocation.\n\n'He saw acting as a necessity. He was serious about it, very committed. He was exceptional in that regard. He's a thoughtful man who cares beyond the frivolity of putting on a show.\n\n'He sees performance as a powerful gift that he has, and that he hopes can change things for good.\n\n'We always hoped that this poetic soul would find a place for his vision.'\n\nDirector Lee would give him his big break, with the young actor playing a teenage army specialist alongside Steve Martin, Kristen Stewart and Vin Diesel in Billy Lynn's Long Halftime Walk.\n\n'From the first reading, from halfway in the first scene, there's no doubt, he's top-notch talent,' director Lee recalled. 'I was worried: Is he too handsome? But then his face is so compelling, it doesn't matter.'\n\nModel pose: Alwyn, pictured, was reportedly introduced to Swift by Gigi Hadid after doing a modelling shoot with her last year\n\nPromising start: Director Ang Lee would give him his big break, with the young actor joining a cast that inluded Steve Martin, Kristen Stewart and Vin Diesel as a teenage army specialist in Billy Lynn's Long Halftime Walk\n\nLooking back at their first meeting, casting director Avy Kaufman added: 'Joe came with a backpack, with like one pair of underwear. He had not a clue he was going to stay. When I met him in person, he was just like how he was in the tape.'\n\n'I'd never been to America, and I was told I'd be going home the next day,' Alwyn told the Evening Standard of that first audition. 'So I turned up with a tiny little rucksack and a pair of boxers and a T-shirt.'\n\nHe eventually flew to Atlanta for screen tests before discovering he'd landed the role during an early morning call from his agent, less than day after returning to London.\n\nReflecting on his breakthrough character, he told The Hollywood Reporter: 'In many ways, he's a long, long way away from me. I'm from London, and he's a Texan soldier.\n\n'But at the heart of it, the story is about a boy finding his place in the world. Although that takes place within this framework of this halftime show and the war and all these bigger things swirling around him, its heart is something very relatable.'\n\nTwo months after his film debut, he landed another major role, in an adaptation of Julian Barnes' Booker-winning The Sense of an Ending.\n\nSigned by prominent American talent group Creative Artists Agency (CAA), Alwyn will next be seen in director Kristoffer Nyholm's Keepers, a psychological thriller that also stars Gerard Butler and Peter Mullan.\n\nHe's got The X Factor: Taylor enjoyed a brief romance with One Direction star Harry Styles in 2012\n\nHighland fling: She would later develop a year long relationship with Scottish DJ Calvin Harris\n\nThat was rather Hiddleswift: After dumping Harris, Taylor quickly became involved in a notoriously high profile romance with actor Tom Hiddleston\n\nBut as the actor remains focused on a promising future, he has also reflected on his past - namely childhood memories of his film-maker father.\n\n'When I was growing up my dad was away a lot,' he told the Evening Standard. 'He did a lot of work in crisis zones, places like Uganda or Rwanda.\n\n'When your dad comes back from a faraway land with bows and arrows and spears wrapped up in a carpet... that's cool.'\n\nAway from the spotlight, Joe reveals a disarming, down to earth nature.\n\nSpeaking to Vanity Fair about his likes and dislikes, the actor admitted he still uses London buses, loves a good old fashioned Indian curry and anything by rapper Eminem as his favourite karaoke number.\n\nAnd given his sudden exposure to fame, the actor has unsurprisingly hinted at an underlying insecurity as he adjusts to life in the public eye.\n\n'I don't think that's something that ever goes away, the feeling that you're a fraud,' he told the Evening Standard. 'Maybe that's something that drives you.\n\n'But yeah, I might always have that feeling of: 'I'm gonna get found out and I shouldn't be here.'", "images":

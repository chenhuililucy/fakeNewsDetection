Today\u2019s One Love Manchester benefit concert will not only continue, but will do so with greater purpose.\u201d\n\nThe sold-out concert will include performances by Grande, Justin Bieber, Coldplay, Katy Perry, Miley Cyrus, Pharrell Williams and more. Gates will open at 6 p.m. local time at the Manchester concert Sunday. The concert is happening nearly two weeks after a bomber killed 22 people at her Manchester Arena show on May 22. Proceeds from the event will go to the We Love Manchester Emergency Fund, set up by the Manchester City Council and the British Red Cross to aid victims and their families.\n\nHere's how to watch, stream Ariana Grande's Manchester concert in the U.S.\n\nGrande said she was praying for London in a tweet shared Saturday night.\n\nEvent Commander, Chief Superintendent Stuart Ellison, said everyone coming to the concert will be searched at the event.\n\n\u201cI can understand some nervousness from members of the public perhaps but I can reassure them \u2026 they will see a heightened police presence.\u201d\n\nEllison said armed police officers will be at the gates and inside the venue. John Fryer, major event transport planning lead with Transport for Greater Manchester, said those who plan to attend the concert should not drive. Free transportation is available. More information is available at tfgm.com.\n\nLate Saturday, police said a van plowed into pedestrians on London Bridge and that assailants went on a stabbing rampage at nearby Borough Market. It was the third terror attack in Britain in less than three months.\n\nFollow Ashley May on Twitter: @AshleyMayTweets", "images": ["https://www.usatoday.com/gcdn/-mm-/b123ec659af63a7a8e71f1896fba30839745b882/c=0-33-679-416/local/-/media/2017/06/04/USATODAY/USATODAY/636321553895303700-AP-Britain-Concert-Blast.jpg?width=679&height=383&fit=crop&format=pjpg&auto=webp", "https://www.usatoday.com/gcdn/presto/2022/08/01/USAT/747340f5-ba21-4a8c-8105-ff2ea23cc1ed-Ashley_May_-_UNow.JPG?crop=682,682,x1,y111&width=48&height=48&format=pjpg&auto=webp"], "top_img": "https://www.usatoday.com/gcdn/-mm-/b123ec659af63a7a8e71f1896fba30839745b882/c=0-33-679-416/local/-/media/2017/06/04/USATODAY/USATODAY/636321553895303700-AP-Britain-Concert-Blast.jpg?width=679&height=383&fit=crop&format=pjpg&auto=webp", "keywords": [], "authors": [], "canonical_link": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/life/music/2017/06/04/after-london-attack-ariana-grande-one-love-concert-manchester-go/368861001/", "title": "After London terror attack, Ariana Grande concert in Manchester will go on as planned", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1,minimum-scale=1", "theme-color": "#0098FE", "og": {"title": "After London terror attack, Ariana Grande concert in Manchester will go on as planned", "description": "Ariana Grande\u2019s show promoter assures fans her One Love concert will go on as planned.", "url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/life/music/2017/06/04/after-london-attack-ariana-grande-one-love-concert-manchester-go/368861001/", "site_name": "USA TODAY", "image": {"identifier": "https://www.usatoday.com/gcdn/-mm-/b123ec659af63a7a8e71f1896fba30839745b882/c=0-33-679-416/local/-/media/2017/06/04/USATODAY/USATODAY/636321553895303700-AP-Britain-Concert-Blast.jpg?width=679&height=383&fit=crop&format=pjpg&auto=webp", "width": 679, "height": 383}, "type": "article"}, "article": {"author": "Ashley May", "content_tier": "free", "opinion": "false"}, "description": "Ariana Grande\u2019s show promoter assures fans her One Love concert will go on as planned.", "fb": {"pages": "13652355666,48958576760,156345381090801,110471702456365,6566864515,137698179626815,315942225236045,927427260614748,183850168300771,1443524575938047,251228454889939,158095147555989,115535341805950,236655713446291,1621466394844549,250325640686,177037772444433,1972936962947967,2047091012096533,535551216797440", "app_id": 215046668549694}, "ROBOTS": "NOODP, NOYDIR, max-image-preview:large", "google": "notranslate", "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "image": "https://www.usatoday.com/gcdn/-mm-/b123ec659af63a7a8e71f1896fba30839745b882/c=0-33-679-416/local/-/media/2017/06/04/USATODAY/USATODAY/636321553895303700-AP-Britain-Concert-Blast.jpg?width=679&height=339&fit=crop&format=pjpg&auto=webp", "site": "@usatoday", "creator": "@usatoday", "title": "After London terror attack, Ariana Grande concert in Manchester will go on as planned", "description": "Ariana Grande\u2019s show promoter assures fans her One Love concert will go on as planned."}}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1496505600.0, "source": "https://www.usatoday.com", "summary": ""}

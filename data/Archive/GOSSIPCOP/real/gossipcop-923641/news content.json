I admit it! Fake hair, and I did my nose. I feel I have a responsibility to tell the truth.\"\n\nBanks told the publication that despite the praise celebrities get for donning makeup-free looks, it's necessary for some.\n\n\u201cI get really uncomfortable when women who are these natural beauties judge anybody who does anything to themselves.\u201d\n\n\"We place a lot of emphasis on (the no makeup look),\" Banks said. \"As a model, I needed makeup. I don't think there's anything wrong with that. It leveled my playing field. Gisele, you don't need it? I do! And we're both modeling for Victoria's Secret.\"\n\nBanks said women should be able to \"fix it or flaunt it\" and do both as they choose without judgement.\n\n\u201cIf you like your natural self, don\u2019t worry about it,\u201d she said. \u201cBut if you feel insecure about something \u2026 I have a magic bag of beauty tricks to make you who you want to be. Permanent or temporary, I do not judge that.\u201d\n\n\"Perfect is Boring\" will be released April 3.", "images": ["https://www.ajc.com/pf/resources/images/ajc-hamburger-menu.png?d=1002", "https://www.ajc.com/pf/resources/images/amp-close.png?d=1002", "https://www.ajc.com/pf/resources/logos/AJC/sidebar-logo.png?d=1002", "https://www.ajc.com/news/national/tyra-banks-admits-she-had-nose-job-early-her-career-new-memoir/eUQBSOFLPNsX4mIx4H1qqM/[object Object]", "https://www.ajc.com/resizer/SdPdBQQGDgZJrvM57hERTPNqS1w=/1200x630/d1fegwn2wjh0cs.cloudfront.net/06-28-2020/t_bc4d78e029f648d0a11cd9745b3b59d9_name_FF761C943B9644ABB413361F1EC20BE9"], "top_img": "https://www.ajc.com/resizer/SdPdBQQGDgZJrvM57hERTPNqS1w=/1200x630/d1fegwn2wjh0cs.cloudfront.net/06-28-2020/t_bc4d78e029f648d0a11cd9745b3b59d9_name_FF761C943B9644ABB413361F1EC20BE9", "keywords": [], "authors": ["About The Author", "Kelcie Willis", "Cox Media Group National Content Desk"], "canonical_link": "https://www.ajc.com/news/national/tyra-banks-admits-she-had-nose-job-early-her-career-new-memoir/eUQBSOFLPNsX4mIx4H1qqM/", "title": "Tyra Banks admits she had a nose job early in her career in new memoir", "meta_data": {"description": "Tyra Banks confirmed what many have suspected for years in her new book: She had a nose job.", "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "description": "Tyra Banks confirmed what many have suspected for years in her new book: She had a nose job.", "image": "https://www.ajc.com/resizer/SdPdBQQGDgZJrvM57hERTPNqS1w=/1200x630/d1fegwn2wjh0cs.cloudfront.net/06-28-2020/t_bc4d78e029f648d0a11cd9745b3b59d9_name_FF761C943B9644ABB413361F1EC20BE9", "site": "@ajc", "title": "Tyra Banks admits she had a nose job early in her career in new memoir", "url": "https://www.ajc.com/news/national/tyra-banks-admits-she-had-nose-job-early-her-career-new-memoir/eUQBSOFLPNsX4mIx4H1qqM/"}, "fb": {"app_id": 366816260017522, "pages": 13310147298}, "og": {"image": {"identifier": "https://www.ajc.com/resizer/SdPdBQQGDgZJrvM57hERTPNqS1w=/1200x630/d1fegwn2wjh0cs.cloudfront.net/06-28-2020/t_bc4d78e029f648d0a11cd9745b3b59d9_name_FF761C943B9644ABB413361F1EC20BE9", "secure_url": "https://www.ajc.com/resizer/SdPdBQQGDgZJrvM57hERTPNqS1w=/1200x630/d1fegwn2wjh0cs.cloudfront.net/06-28-2020/t_bc4d78e029f648d0a11cd9745b3b59d9_name_FF761C943B9644ABB413361F1EC20BE9", "type": "image/jpeg", "height": 630, "width": 1200}, "title": "Tyra Banks admits she had a nose job early in her career in new memoir", "type": "article", "url": "https://www.ajc.com/news/national/tyra-banks-admits-she-had-nose-job-early-her-career-new-memoir/eUQBSOFLPNsX4mIx4H1qqM/", "description": "Tyra Banks confirmed what many have suspected for years in her new book: She had a nose job.", "site_name": "ajc"}, "thumbnail": "https://www.ajc.com/resizer/SdPdBQQGDgZJrvM57hERTPNqS1w=/1200x630/d1fegwn2wjh0cs.cloudfront.net/06-28-2020/t_bc4d78e029f648d0a11cd9745b3b59d9_name_FF761C943B9644ABB413361F1EC20BE9", "language": "English", "article": {"opinion": "false"}, "story.meter": "free", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": null, "source": "https://www.ajc.com", "summary": ""}

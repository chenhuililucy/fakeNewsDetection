Kirsty Wigglesworth / AP\n\nIt's a trend also seen with Louis' older brother, Prince George, too. So what's the story behind the shorts?\n\nIn 2016, when George was a youngster, Harper\u2019s Bazaar UK did some investigating, and they found that dressing young boys in shorts is a long-standing tradition among British royalty and aristocracy.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a very English thing to dress a young boy in shorts,\u201d British etiquette expert William Hanson told Bazaar. \u201cTrousers are for older boys and men, whereas shorts on young boys is one of those silent class markers that we have in England. Although times are (slowly) changing, a pair of trousers on a young boy is considered quite middle class\u2013quite suburban. And no self-respecting aristo or royal would want to be considered suburban.\u201d\n\nMost boys graduate to full-length trousers at about 8 years old, Hanson explained. He said the shorts-only tradition may stem from the antiquated custom of \u201cbreeching,\u201d which dates back centuries in the U.K.\n\nWilliam and Kate with their three children, George, Louis and Charlotte.

The Prince of Wales sported a very similar look in his younger years:\n\nA young Prince William with his mother, the late Princess Diana.\n\n\u201cThe British upper set are always keen to hold on to tradition, and this one also silently marks them out from \u2018the rest,\u201d Hanson told Bazaar.", "images": ["https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-760w,f_auto,q_auto:best/rockcms/2022-12/princess-diana-prince-william-shorts-inline-today-161007-4a3d9a.jpg", "https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_focal-120x180,f_auto,q_auto:best/newscms/2021_41/1787172/web-discovery-parents-mc-211012.jpg", "https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_focal-120x180,f_auto,q_auto:best/newscms/2023_02/1956625/harry-styles-mc-220527-bcf010.jpg", "https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_focal-120x180,f_auto,q_auto:best/newscms/2021_41/1787173/web-discovery-shopping-mc-211012.jpg", "https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_focal-120x180,f_auto,q_auto:best/newscms/2023_02/1956581/today-navigation-life-jp-f3a42a.jpg", "https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-760w,f_auto,q_auto:best/rockcms/2022-12/prince-louis-shorts-mc-221227-03-a47a91.jpg", "https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_focal-120x180,f_auto,q_auto:best/newscms/2021_41/1787151/web-discovery-style-mc-211012_copy.jpg", "https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/w_10000,h_74,q_80,c_fit,f_auto,q_auto:best/newscms/2018_52/2696491/williegeist.png", "https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_focal-120x180,f_auto,q_auto:best/newscms/2021_41/1787140/web-discovery-health-mc-211012.jpg", "https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-760w,f_auto,q_auto:best/rockcms/2022-12/prince-louis-shorts-mc-221227-08-4ac8d9.jpg", "https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_focal-120x180,f_auto,q_auto:best/newscms/2022_03/1831075/covid-test-main-aw-220117-3bff61.jpeg", "https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/w_10000,h_74,q_80,c_fit,f_auto,q_auto:best/newscms/2023_41/2034909/hoda-jenna-new-pic-2-te-231010.png", "https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/w_10000,h_74,q_80,c_fit,f_auto,q_auto:best/newscms/2019_18/1432044/today-3rd-hour.png", "https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-760w,f_auto,q_auto:best/rockcms/2022-12/prince-louis-shorts-mc-221227-05-389c83.jpg", "https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_focal-120x180,f_auto,q_auto:best/newscms/2021_41/1787138/web-discovery-food-mc-211012.jpg", "https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_social_share_1200x630_center,f_auto,q_auto:best/rockcms/2022-12/prince-louis-shorts-mc-221227-04-351431.jpg", "https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/w_10000,h_74,q_80,c_fit,f_auto,q_auto:best/rockcms/2022-10/TODAY-menu-2022-431ed9.png"], "top_img": "https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_social_share_1200x630_center,f_auto,q_auto:best/rockcms/2022-12/prince-louis-shorts-mc-221227-04-351431.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Lindsay Lowe", "Lindsay Lowe Has Been A Regular Contributor To Today.Com Since", "Covering Pop Culture", "Style", "Home", "Other Lifestyle Topics.

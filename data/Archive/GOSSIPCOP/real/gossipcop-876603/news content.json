This time, they\u2019re taking on EDM with their new song \u201cGet It.\u201d The new track debuted over the weekend at the Livewire Festival 2017 at Blackpool\u2019s Tower Headland Arena in England, according to E! News.\n\nThe two also performed their classic songs such as \u201cMen In Black,\u201d \u201cGettin\u2019 Jiggy Wit\u2019 It,\u201d \u201cGirls Ain\u2019t Nothing But Trouble,\u201d \u201cMiami,\u201d and \u201cJust The Two Of Us.\u201d\n\nThis is their first collaboration since their 1998\u2019s \u201cLovely Daze.\u201d Will, who become a Hollywood superstar, has not released a solo album since Lost and Found in 2005.\n\nNME reports that the 48-year-old actor said to the audience that the song was a reaction to the \u201cchaos and confusion in the world.\u201d\n\n\u201cI wanted to make a song that allowed people to let their light shine. We all have an inner light and sometimes this world,\u201d the Hitch star said onstage.\n\n\u201cPeople can say stuff to you and tell you you can\u2019t do and you know you can but when they tell you that it kinda knocks you down a bit right so I wanted to make a record that reminded each and every one of y\u2019all to let your light shine.\u201d\n\nHe added, \u201cShine those lights, let me see those lights. We\u2019re going to shine those lights, we\u2019re going to brighten up the darkness in this world.\u201d", "images": ["https://web.archive.org/web/20170901190851im_/http://omgcheckitout.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/logo_transparent_background_small.png", "https://web.archive.org/web/20170901190851im_/http://omgcheckitout.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/Depositphotos_156662524_original-324x400.jpg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20170901190851im_/http://omgcheckitout.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/shutterstock_4377575ih.jpg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20170901190851im_/http://omgcheckitout.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/shutterstock_8870715e-324x400.jpg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20170901190851im_/http://omgcheckitout.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/shutterstock_4377575ih-683x1024.jpg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20170901190851im_/http://omgcheckitout.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/shutterstock_5668419aa-324x400.jpg"], "top_img": "https://web.archive.org/web/20170901190851im_/http://omgcheckitout.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/shutterstock_4377575ih.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Pie L"], "canonical_link": "https://web.archive.org/web/20170901190851/http://omgcheckitout.com/will-smith-dj-jazzy-jeff-debut-get-lit-first-song-19-years/", "title": "Will Smith and DJ Jazzy Jeff Debut \u201dGet Lit\u201d \u2013 First Song in 19 Years", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "theme-color": "#ffffff", "og": {"image": {"identifier": "https://web.archive.org/web/20170901190851im_/http://omgcheckitout.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/shutterstock_4377575ih.jpg", "width": 2001, "height": 3002}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "Will Smith and DJ Jazzy Jeff Debut ''Get Lit'' - First Song in 19 Years", "description": "The former music duo Will Smith and DJ Jazzy Jeff are back 19 years after their last song together.

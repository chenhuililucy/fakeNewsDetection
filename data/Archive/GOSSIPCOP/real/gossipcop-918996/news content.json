However, instead of just ignoring the calls to run for president, she decided to turn to prayer.\n\n\"I went into prayer,\" she told People. \"'God, if you think I'm supposed to run, you gotta tell me, and it has to be so clear that not even I can miss it.' And I haven't gotten that.\"\n\nWinfrey was surprised to hear the response to her moving speech, telling the publication that she was happy with her speech, but she never expected the reaction that it got.\n\n\u201cWhen I walked off with Reese [Witherspoon], I thought, \u2018I got that done,\u2019\u201d Winfrey said. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t until I was back in the press room that they said, \u2018Do you realize you\u2019re trending?\u2019\u201d\n\nSoon after the speech, people started contacting her, encouraging her to run, including close friends, such as best friend Gayle King, and billionaires offering to fund her campaign.\n\n>> Read more trending news\n\n\u201cI had people \u2013 wealthy, billionaires \u2013 calling me up and saying, \u2018I can get you a billion dollars. I can run your campaign,\u2019\u201d she revealed. \u201cThat many people saying something made me think, \u2018Am I at least supposed to look at the question?\u2019\u201d\n\nStill, Winfrey had previously said the job doesn't \"interest\" her and that she doesn't think she has the \"DNA\" to be president, the Telegraph reported.", "images": ["https://www.ajc.com/pf/resources/images/ajc-hamburger-menu.png?d=1003", "https://www.ajc.com/entertainment/oprah-says-god-would-have-tell-her-run-for-president/C11E8r9aNtaqTFcEvHPzbK/[object Object]", "https://www.ajc.com/resizer/ej5cA1-O9pSNllTD6scGMscvMhs=/1200x630/d1fegwn2wjh0cs.cloudfront.net/06-28-2020/t_d25cd88e9c1e47888c2ca967c890c474_name_5BD4E6AC78844DFD8492727AF528BD1E", "https://www.ajc.com/pf/resources/images/amp-close.png?d=1003", "https://www.ajc.com/pf/resources/logos/AJC/sidebar-logo.png?d=1003"], "top_img": "https://www.ajc.com/resizer/ej5cA1-O9pSNllTD6scGMscvMhs=/1200x630/d1fegwn2wjh0cs.cloudfront.net/06-28-2020/t_d25cd88e9c1e47888c2ca967c890c474_name_5BD4E6AC78844DFD8492727AF528BD1E", "keywords": [], "authors": ["About The Author", "Elizabeth Vale"], "canonical_link": "https://www.ajc.com/entertainment/oprah-says-god-would-have-tell-her-run-for-president/C11E8r9aNtaqTFcEvHPzbK/", "title": "Oprah says God would have to tell her to run for president", "meta_data": {"description": "Oprah Winfrey previously\u00a0made it clear that she has no plans to run for president of the United States in 2020, but she revealed to\u00a0People magazine th", "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "description": "Oprah Winfrey previously\u00a0made it clear that she has no plans to run for president of the United States in 2020, but she revealed to\u00a0People magazine that\u00a0there\u2019s one thing that could make her change her mind: God.", "image": "https://www.ajc.com/resizer/ej5cA1-O9pSNllTD6scGMscvMhs=/1200x630/d1fegwn2wjh0cs.cloudfront.net/06-28-2020/t_d25cd88e9c1e47888c2ca967c890c474_name_5BD4E6AC78844DFD8492727AF528BD1E", "site": "@ajc", "title": "Oprah says God would have to tell her to run for president", "url": "https://www.ajc.com/entertainment/oprah-says-god-would-have-tell-her-run-for-president/C11E8r9aNtaqTFcEvHPzbK/"}, "fb": {"app_id": 366816260017522, "pages": 13310147298}, "og": {"image": {"identifier": "https://www.ajc.com/resizer/ej5cA1-O9pSNllTD6scGMscvMhs=/1200x630/d1fegwn2wjh0cs.cloudfront.net/06-28-2020/t_d25cd88e9c1e47888c2ca967c890c474_name_5BD4E6AC78844DFD8492727AF528BD1E", "secure_url": "https://www.ajc.com/resizer/ej5cA1-O9pSNllTD6scGMscvMhs=/1200x630/d1fegwn2wjh0cs.cloudfront.net/06-28-2020/t_d25cd88e9c1e47888c2ca967c890c474_name_5BD4E6AC78844DFD8492727AF528BD1E", "type": "image/jpeg", "height": 630, "width": 1200}, "title": "Oprah says God would have to tell her to run for president", "type": "article", "url": "https://www.ajc.com/entertainment/oprah-says-god-would-have-tell-her-run-for-president/C11E8r9aNtaqTFcEvHPzbK/", "description": "Oprah Winfrey previously\u00a0made it clear that she has no plans to run for president of the United States in 2020, but she revealed to\u00a0People magazine that\u00a0there\u2019s one thing that could make her change her mind: God.", "site_name": "ajc"}, "thumbnail": "https://www.ajc.com/resizer/ej5cA1-O9pSNllTD6scGMscvMhs=/1200x630/d1fegwn2wjh0cs.cloudfront.net/06-28-2020/t_d25cd88e9c1e47888c2ca967c890c474_name_5BD4E6AC78844DFD8492727AF528BD1E", "language": "English", "article": {"opinion": "false"}, "story.meter": "free", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": null, "source": "https://www.ajc.com", "summary": ""}

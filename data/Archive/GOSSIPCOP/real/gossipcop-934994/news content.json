We want them to grow up as normal as possible. And so when they\u2019re old enough to decide they want a camera in their face, that\u2019s one thing, but for now we just want to keep them kids.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe actress, who starred in \u201cThe Hills,\u201d doesn\u2019t even like to expose her children \u2014 Saylor James, 2; Jaxon Wyatt, 4; and Camden Jack, 5 \u2014 on social media. She told People in May: \u201cIf I post them, it\u2019s of the back of their head or something to that degree.\u201d\n\nA post shared by Kristin Cavallari (@kristincavallari) on May 13, 2018 at 7:32am PDT\n\nThe 31-year-old starred on her first reality show, \u201cLaguna Beach,\u201d when she was only 17 and said she cringes when she watches reruns.\n\n\u201cI didn\u2019t know what I was getting into,\u201d Cavallari told People. \u201cI was just going about my life and doing what producers were asking me to do. When I saw the first season, I was devastated about how I was portrayed.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHer husband, who played for the Denver Broncos, Chicago Bears and Miami Dolphins, is also no stranger to television. People had reported that he was hesitant to participate in \u201cVery Cavallari,\u201d which will also focus on Cavallari\u2019s budding jewelry and home goods business called Uncommon James.\n\nBut apparently, Cutler had a change of heart. He appeared numerous times on the first episode, offering comic relief by dumping a cooler full of dead elk meat on their posh kitchen counter and explaining why he doesn\u2019t wear heels.\n\nMany people on Twitter thought Cutler stole the show.\n\nI was more entertained by Jay Cutler on #VeryCavallari than I was during his whole football career with the Bears. \u2014 Missy (@MISSYclarin) July 9, 2018\n\nJay Cutler as a QB: Garbage\n\n\n\nJay Cutler as a reality star: Legend \u2014 Justin Hughes (@j_hughes1214) July 9, 2018\n\nAdvertisement\n\nJay Cutler better win a best supporting actor award for Very Cavallari \u2014 Good Brother (@JoeySuba) July 9, 2018\n\nWho needs scenes of the kids when Cutler is giving us comedy gold?", "images": ["https://pixel.quantserve.com/pixel/p-3aud4J6uA4Z6Y.gif", "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5c1161451f0000c407267e90.jpg?ops=100_100", "https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6723616&c3=&c4=&c5=&c6=&c15=&cj=1", "https://www.facebook.com/tr?id=1621685564716533&ev=PageView&noscript=1", "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5b43bd7d2000004200b96893.jpeg?cache=lCilqxrsfz&ops=1200_630", "data:image/png;base64,iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAAAAEAAAABCAQAAAC1HAwCAAAAC0lEQVR42mNkYAAAAAYAAjCB0C8AAAAASUVORK5CYII="], "top_img": "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5b43bd7d2000004200b96893.jpeg?cache=lCilqxrsfz&ops=1200_630", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Senior Reporter"], "canonical_link": "https://www.huffpost.com/entry/kristin-cavallari-kids-wont-appear-new-reality-show_n_5b439c67e4b048036ea14b01", "title": "Kristin Cavallari Reveals Why Her Kids Won\u2019t Appear On Her New Reality Show", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, minimum-scale=1.0", "description": "\u201cVery Cavallari\u201d will focus on the reality TV star, her budding business and her scene-stealing husband, Jay Cutler.", "keywords": "Celebrities,reality television,Kristin Cavallari,jay cutler,Very Cavallari", "fb": {"app_id": 46744042133}, "og": {"title": "Kristin Cavallari Reveals Why Her Kids Won\u2019t Appear On Her New Reality Show", "type": "article", "image": {"identifier": "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5b43bd7d2000004200b96893.jpeg?cache=lCilqxrsfz&ops=1200_630", "url": "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5b43bd7d2000004200b96893.jpeg?cache=lCilqxrsfz&ops=1200_630", "type": "image/jpeg", "width": 1200, "height": 630}, "url": "https://www.huffpost.com/entry/kristin-cavallari-kids-wont-appear-new-reality-show_n_5b439c67e4b048036ea14b01", "site_name": "HuffPost", "locale": "en_US", "description": "\u201cVery Cavallari\u201d will focus on the reality TV star, her budding business and her scene-stealing husband, Jay Cutler."}, "article": {"tag": "Celebrities,reality television,Kristin Cavallari,jay cutler,Very Cavallari", "section": "Entertainment", "published_time": "2018-07-09T21:12:01Z", "modified_time": "2018-07-09T21:30:30Z"}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "site": "@HuffPostEnt", "title": "Kristin Cavallari Reveals Why Her Kids Won\u2019t Appear On Her New Reality Show", "image": {"identifier": "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5b43bd7d2000004200b96893.jpeg?cache=lCilqxrsfz&ops=1200_630", "width": 1200, "height": 630}, "description": "\u201cVery Cavallari\u201d will focus on the reality TV star, her budding business and her scene-stealing husband, Jay Cutler."}, "al": {"ios": {"url": "huffpostnews:///?editionID=us&entryID=us_5b439c67e4b048036ea14b01", "app_store_id": 306621789, "app_name": "HuffPost"}}, "robots": "max-snippet:-1,max-image-preview:large,max-video-preview:-1", "google-site-verification": "97Mj-wW7u8U1NOnkW1rfH-I1kgO0-a9YsgoesOk41R8"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1531170721.0, "source": "https://www.huffingtonpost.com", "summary": ""}

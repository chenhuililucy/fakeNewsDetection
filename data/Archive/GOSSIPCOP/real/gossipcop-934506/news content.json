Queen Elizabeth II was seen chatting alongside her husband from outside the vehicle in several photos captured at the event.\n\nGetty Images\n\nGetty Images\n\nThe Duke of Edinburgh appeared to be in good spirits, but was not photographed getting out of the vehicle. Her Majesty walked next to the parked car, wearing a floral headscarf, dark sunglasses, and navy blue coat.\n\n\n\nMore From Town & Country\n\nPrince Philip's resurgence into the public eye might give a bit of insight into whether he will be healthy enough to attend Prince Harry and Meghan Markle's upcoming nuptials on May 19. However, a spokesperson for Kensington Palace shared earlier this month that the Duke might not be at the royal wedding.\n\nRoyal expert Katie Nicholl told ET back in November that Harry had expedited the wedding in the hopes of staying ahead of his grandfather's health issues.\n\n\n\nGetty Images\n\n\"In fact, one of the reasons that Prince Harry has wanted this wedding to happen quite quickly\u2014this is really whirlwind by royal standards\u2014is because his 96-year-old grandfather, the Duke of Edinburgh, is retired now and Prince Harry really wants him to be at his wedding,\" Nicholl said.\n\nOn April 13, Buckingham Palace announced that Prince Philip's health was in much better condition. \"Prince Philip left King Edward VII\u2019s Hospital at midday today, following a hip replacement operation last week,\" the statement read. \"He will continue his recovery at Windsor. His Royal Highness would like to convey his appreciation for the messages of good wishes he has received.\"", "images":

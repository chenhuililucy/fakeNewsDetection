When Masterpiece did its rebranding in 2008, the series was divided into three seasons. We decided that having a different host for each season would help to differentiate the programming for the audience. Laura Linney is an elegant and classic as the dramas she introduces.\"", "images": ["https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bb56a79200000e80000bc47.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale", "https://pixel.quantserve.com/pixel/p-3aud4J6uA4Z6Y.gif", "https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6723616&c3=&c4=&c5=&c6=&c15=&cj=1", "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bb406b9250000cf0038d7e4.jpeg?ops=scalefit_960_noupscale", "https://www.facebook.com/tr?id=1621685564716533&ev=PageView&noscript=1", "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/default-entry.jpg?ops=1200_630"], "top_img": "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/default-entry.jpg?ops=1200_630", "keywords": [], "authors": ["News Editor", "Huffpost Tv"], "canonical_link": "https://www.huffpost.com/entry/laura-linney-downton-abbey_n_2426321", "title": "Why Does Laura Linney Introduce 'Downton Abbey'?", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, minimum-scale=1.0", "description": "Why Does Laura Linney Introduce 'Downton Abbey'?", "keywords": "downton abbey pbs,downton abbey ,masterpiece,Video, tv,tv canada,Reality-Free", "fb": {"app_id": 46744042133}, "og": {"title": "Why Does Laura Linney Introduce 'Downton Abbey'?", "type": "article", "image": {"identifier": "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/default-entry.jpg?ops=1200_630", "url": "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/default-entry.jpg?ops=1200_630", "type": "image/jpeg", "width": 1200, "height": 630}, "url": "https://www.huffpost.com/entry/laura-linney-downton-abbey_n_2426321", "site_name": "HuffPost", "locale": "en_US", "description": "Why Does Laura Linney Introduce 'Downton Abbey'?"}, "article": {"tag": "downton abbey pbs,downton abbey ,masterpiece,Video, tv,tv canada,Reality-Free", "section": "TV & Film", "published_time": "2013-01-07T19:34:50Z", "modified_time": "2017-12-07T03:03:21Z"}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "site": "@null", "title": "Why Does Laura Linney Introduce 'Downton Abbey'?", "image": {"identifier": "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/default-entry.jpg?ops=1200_630", "width": 1200, "height": 630}, "description": "Why Does Laura Linney Introduce 'Downton Abbey'?"}, "al": {"ios": {"url": "huffpostnews:///?editionID=us&entryID=us_5bb56a79e4b0af0870348b56", "app_store_id": 306621789, "app_name": "HuffPost"}}, "robots": "max-snippet:-1,max-image-preview:large,max-video-preview:-1", "google-site-verification": "97Mj-wW7u8U1NOnkW1rfH-I1kgO0-a9YsgoesOk41R8"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1357488000.0, "source": "https://www.huffingtonpost.com", "summary": ""}

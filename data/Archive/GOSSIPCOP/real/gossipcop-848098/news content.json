So, naturally, season 2 begins with the friends finding a new place to hide as they strategize on how to deal with their diabolical parental units. \u201cIt\u2019s in Griffith Park,\u201d Savage explains of the hideout, which is called the Hostel in the comics that inspired the streaming series. \u201cIt was originally built in the 1920s by a magician. It was lived in for many years, [but] perhaps sometime in the \u201960s or \u201970s there was an earthquake or mudslide that made it uninhabitable.\u201d Adds Schwartz, \u201cWe wanted it to be our equivalent of, like, the Batcave.\u201d Teenagers really need a place to hang out\u2026even if it\u2019s an underground dust-filled mansion.\n\nGreg Lewis / Hulu\n\nIn the above photo from episode 4, the gang enjoys a candlelit meal in the dining room with Molly\u2019s (Allegra Acosta) enigmatic new acquaintance Topher (Jan Luis Castellanos). \u201cHe is a character who\u2019s from the comics,\u201d Schwartz teases of the character also seen in the new trailer. \u201cHe\u2019s not all that he appears to be.\u201d Interiors for the Hostel were constructed at Paramount Studios in Los Angeles and were massive. \u201cIt\u2019s the biggest set that Marvel Television has ever built,\u201d says Schwartz. \u201cWhen [comic co-creator] Brian K. Vaughan came to the set for the first time, he had tears in his eyes.\u201d We\u2019re pretty sure it wasn\u2019t the dust.\n\nGreg Lewis / Hulu\n\nThe Hostel even blesses the group with some new accessories thanks to an antiquated but full closet. \u201cThere\u2019s the perfect wide-legged 1970s jeans for Karolina (Virginia Gardner) and the perfect leather jacket for Gert (Ariela Barer) and an adorable tiny tuxedo jacket for Nico (Lyrica Okanu),\u201d says Savage. \u201cSo everything you\u2019d want from every era is hiding in that closet.\u201d No one wants to be dressed in sweats when you\u2019re saving the world.\n\nMarvel\u2019s Runaways returns Dec. 21 on Hulu.\n\nRelated content:", "images": ["https://ew.com/thmb/QeHalTsdo0y5FwoJGrcXb5oLmpg=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/runaways-2000-ddc4c7e05238476b9a76ee10711a4021.jpg", "https://ew.com/thmb/Zph5KH0MCL3fVYEjv8Xbe_nAkFc=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/015-2000-5030374b4a9e49fcafe604936dfc59d8.jpg", "https://ew.com/thmb/cduHqU4HfCuZKGUHzoTurm-X3cQ=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/025-2000-0566a46881044df3a8712d125b2660b0.jpg"], "top_img": "https://ew.com/thmb/QeHalTsdo0y5FwoJGrcXb5oLmpg=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/runaways-2000-ddc4c7e05238476b9a76ee10711a4021.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Ew'S Editorial Guidelines"], "canonical_link": "https://ew.com/tv/2018/11/29/marvels-runaways-trailer-first-look/", "title": "Marvel's Runaways: See the new trailer and a first look at the epic lair", "meta_data": {"robots": "max-image-preview:large, NOODP, NOYDIR", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "description": "The Hulu series from Josh Schwartz and Stephanie Savage unveils its massive new set and footage.", "parsely-section": "TV", "parsely-tags": "Celebrity,People,TV,Josh Schwartz,Stephanie Savage,Exclusive,Marvel's Runaways", "article": {"section": "EW", "author": "https://www.facebook.com/entertainmentweekly"}, "fb": {"app_id": 2485718348341688}, "og": {"type": "article", "site_name": "EW.com", "url": "https://ew.com/tv/2018/11/29/marvels-runaways-trailer-first-look/", "title": "Exclusive: See the new 'Marvel's Runaways' trailer and a first look at the epic lair", "description": "The Hulu series from Josh Schwartz and Stephanie Savage unveils its massive new set and footage.", "image": "https://ew.com/thmb/QeHalTsdo0y5FwoJGrcXb5oLmpg=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/runaways-2000-ddc4c7e05238476b9a76ee10711a4021.jpg"}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "site": "@EW", "title": "Exclusive: See the new 'Marvel's Runaways' trailer and a first look at the epic lair", "description": "The Hulu series from Josh Schwartz and Stephanie Savage unveils its massive new set and footage.", "image": "https://ew.com/thmb/QeHalTsdo0y5FwoJGrcXb5oLmpg=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/runaways-2000-ddc4c7e05238476b9a76ee10711a4021.jpg"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#F4F4F4", "msapplication-TileImage": "/static/1.5.1/icons/favicons/mstile-144x144.png", "msapplication-square70x70logo": "/static/1.5.1/icons/favicons/mstile-70x70.png", "msapplication-square150x150logo": "/static/1.5.1/icons/favicons/mstile-150x150.png", "msapplication-square310x310logo": "/static/1.5.1/icons/favicons/mstile-310x310.png", "msapplication-wide310x150logo": "/static/1.5.1/icons/favicons/mstile-310x150.png"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1543420800.0, "source": "https://ew.com", "summary": ""}

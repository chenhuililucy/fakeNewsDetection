Markle wore a Ralph & Russo couture gown for the photoshoot, which featured a beaded and embroidered see-through top (over a nude lining) and a frothy dark skirt.\n\nThe luxe wardrobe choice was unexpected for a soon-to-be royal, not only for its revealing bodice, but also for its $75,000 price tag. The dress turned heads and ruffled some feathers, but it served as yet another statement of Markle's progressively defying royal tradition.\n\nAlexi Lubormirski, the acclaimed photographer behind the portraits, was \"very shocked with the reaction\" to the dress, he told Entertainment Tonight at The Daily Front Row Fashion Awards on Sunday.\n\nBut the process of how Meghan chose that dress was very simple. \"To be honest, we tried on a couple of different things and that was just one that she felt comfortable in, so we weren\u2019t really thinking, \u2018Is it nude?\u2019 or anything. We just thought, 'Feel comfortable and let\u2019s make some nice pictures,'\" he recalled.\n\nSo there you have it. Meghan wasn't trying to raise eyebrows; she was just being comfortable. (We, too, would like to feel comfortable in couture.)\n\nLubomirski also spilled sweet behind-the-scenes details about his time working with Harry and Meghan, who wanted their portraits to be \"accessible [and] relatable.\"\n\n\"When I went to meet them to see if we vibed, they were just cutesy and every time they looked at each other they were like, [giggling],\u201d Lubomirski added to ET. \u201cI was like, \u2018This is gonna be great. This is gonna be easy.\u2019 I said, \u2018I just want to shoot you like this. This is what you're like.\"\n\nIt looks like we got one of those sweet PDA moments in the finished product:\n\nSurely enough, the actual photoshoot was a breeze for Lubomirski, because his subjects \"were so naturally in love.\" It also helped that both Harry and Meghan were used to being in front of the camera, from his royal duties and her acting career, respectively.\n\n\"So, it was wonderful to have her as a sort of coach on set,\" the photographer described. He kind of led her through and she led him through, and she just made it very nice and easy.\"\n\nWe can only imagine how great their wedding photos will be when they tie the knot on May 19.\n\nWant more royals?

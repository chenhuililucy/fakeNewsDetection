Both Lauer and Roque were seen and photographed at Bright Side Farm, a horse training facility that they had opened in 2013. However, while the couple did spend a lot of time there, they arrived separately, with Roque, who was without a wedding ring, arriving first. Both had been there to watch as their daughter rode through the farm.\n\nTheir sons Jack and Thijs were visibly absent from the trip, but Lauer would, later on, be seen spending time with them in the Hamptons.\n\nWhen Lauer was first fired from \"The Today Show,\" news quickly spread that he and his wife of 11 years were divorcing, as caused by the former news anchor's sexual misconduct scandal as well as his affairs with his co-workers. Lauer released a statement after his termination as well as an apology, saying: \"There are no words to express my sorrow and regret for the pain I have caused others by words and actions. To the people I have hurt, I am truly sorry... Some of what is being said about me is untrue or mischaracterized, but there is enough truth in these stories to make me feel embarrassed and ashamed. I regret that my shame is now shared by the people I cherish deeply. Repairing the damage will take a lot of time and soul searching and I am committed to beginning that effort. It is now my full-time job.\"\n\nA few days prior to their latest family outing, Annette Roque had been spotted leaving a New York law firm, which had everyone assuming that her agenda there had something to do with the end of her marriage to Lauer.", "images": ["https://cdn.christianpost.com/assets/img/social/original/linkedin.svg",

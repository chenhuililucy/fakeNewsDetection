Though he initially said the ink was temporary way back in 2016, the new shots prove it's the real deal.\n\nBen was photographed sans shirt while filming a new movie, \"Triple Frontier,\" alongside Charlie Hunnam, Oscar Isaac and Garrett Hedlund. Though all the photos are kind of amazing, it's Affleck's ink that generated most of the talk online.\n\n\"[It's] fake for a movie,\" Affleck said of the piece in 2016. \"I actually do have a number of tattoos but I try to have them in places where you don't have to do a lot of cover up they get sort of addictive, tattoos, after awhile.\"\n\nDespite his outright lie at the time, exes Jennifer Garner and Jennifer Lopez both chimed in with some serious shade about the tattoo as well. \"You know what we would say in my hometown about that? 'Bless his heart,'\" Garner told Vanity Fair. \"A phoenix rising from the ashes. Am I the ashes in this scenario? I take umbrage. I refuse to be the ashes.\"\n\nOn \"Watch What Happens Live,\" J.Lo added, \"It's awful! What are you doing? His tattoos always have too many colors, they shouldn't be so colorful. They should be cooler.\"\n\nWith the new photos confirming the tatt's authenticity, Twitter piled on the haterade -- see the most savage reactions below:\n\nDon't mock Ben Affleck's phoenix tattoo.

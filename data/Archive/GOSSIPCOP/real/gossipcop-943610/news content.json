Figure skater and America's sweetheart Adam Rippon also attended the gala with his boyfriend, Jussi-Pekka Kajaala, making it their big official red carpet debut.\n\nGetty Images\n\nKajaala is from Finland and is a real estate broker and is just an extremely attractive human being, really.\n\n\n\nMore From Cosmopolitan\n\nThis content is imported from poll. You may be able to find the same content in another format, or you may be able to find more information, at their web site.\n\nThe two started talking in October after Kajaala slid into Rippon's Tinder DM's with a smooth pickup line. Kajaala asked Rippon, \"Are you here for business or are you here just to meet me?\" Clearly it worked because the two have been dating for a few months now.\n\nThis is their first red carpet appearance together, but Kajaala has graced Rippon's Instagram feed multiple times. Here they are cruising through the ocean:\n\nBeing fit:\n\nJust being cute:\n\nAnd celebrating Pride:\n\nAnd while their red carpet debut was so cute, Rippon was focused on making sure people are aware of the Trevor Project's life-saving resources.\n\n\"I think now we should have a serious talk about mental health and suicide prevention,\" Rippon told E! News. \"I think it's important to remember that the Trevor hotline is open 24 hours a day, seven days a week, to anyone. Whether you know someone going through something or you're going through something yourself, it's open and available.\"\n\n\n\nThe Trevor Lifeline is open 24/7 at (866) 488-7386.", "images":

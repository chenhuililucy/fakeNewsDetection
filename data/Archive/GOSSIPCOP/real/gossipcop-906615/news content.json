The actress told PEOPLE while promoting her upcoming Lifetime film \u201cCocaine Godmother\u201d that \u201cthere was no other way\u201d for Douglas to handle the situation.\n\n\u201cThere was no other way than to be preemptive in a story that had to be watched. He did a statement. I think it\u2019s very clear the way that he stands,\u201d Zeta-Jones said. \u201cI cannot elaborate on something that\u2019s so very personal to him.\u201d\n\nZeta-Jones made it clear she supports both her husband\u2019s denial and the #MeToo anti-harassment movement at large: \u201cMy reaction was that as two people who have been in this business \u2014 him longer than me \u2014 was that we support \u2018Me Too\u2019 and the movement more than anybody, anybody \u2014 me as a woman, him as a man.\u201d\n\nIn an interview with Deadline published January 10, Douglas noted that a sexual harassment claim was going to be made against him in the future. The actor said he received a message from his attorney that The Hollywood Reporter was interested in a story involving one of the actor\u2019s former employees who alleges he sexually harassed her approximately 32 years ago. The woman alleges Douglas \u201cspoke raunchily\u201d to her and to his friends when she was around. She also claims Douglas masturbated in front of her.\n\n\u201cI had the choice of waiting for a story to come out, one that will clearly get picked up by other newspapers and magazines, and then I have to sit there and try to defend myself. Or, try to share with the public, a little ahead of the story, my thoughts and concerns,\u201d Douglas said about his decision to come forward before the allegations were made publicly.\n\nDouglas apologized to the woman if he used \u201ccoarse language\u201d in front of her, but he denied ever masturbating in front of her. The actor said this accusation is a \u201ccomplete lie\u201d and that there is \u201cno truth to it whatsoever.\u201d He also expressed concerns over the fact that an allegation could harm the future of his career.", "images": ["https://www.indiewire.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/Zack-Sharf.png?w=300&h=300&crop=1", "https://www.indiewire.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/Basic-Instinct.jpg?w=1500&h=1075&crop=1", "https://www.indiewire.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/GettyImages-1493824575.jpg?w=3000&h=3000&crop=1", "https://www.indiewire.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Event-Horizon-.jpg?w=2779&h=1873&crop=1", "https://www.sportico.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/GettyImages-117540139-e1697478353363.jpg?resize=232,175", "https://pixel.quantserve.com/pixel?a.1=&a.2=p-31f3D02tYU8zY", "https://www.indiewire.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/screen-shot-2018-01-16-at-10-40-59-am.png", "https://www.indiewire.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/GettyImages-78420203.jpg?w=300&h=300&crop=1", "https://www.rollingstone.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/HeladoNegro_SadieCulberson-49.jpeg?resize=232,175", "https://www.indiewire.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/screen-shot-2018-01-16-at-10-40-59-am.png?w=906&h=589&crop=1", "https://www.indiewire.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/Michael-Douglas-and-Evangeline-Lilly.jpg?w=3000&h=1687&crop=1", "https://www.indiewire.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/Fall-Festivals.png?w=1920&h=1080&crop=1", "https://www.indiewire.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/GettyImages-1637257115.jpg?w=3000&h=2667&crop=1", "https://www.indiewire.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/MCDGUOF_WD008.jpg?w=300&h=300&crop=1", "https://www.indiewire.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/image00055.jpeg?w=1920&h=1133&crop=1", "https://tvline.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/snl-taylor-swift-travis-kelce.jpeg?resize=232,175", "https://www.indiewire.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Screen-Shot-2023-05-02-at-1.16.07-PM.png?w=300&h=300&crop=1", "https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/image0-e1697562829300.jpeg?resize=232,175", "https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6035310&c3=&c4=&c5=&c6=&c15=&cv=2.0&cj=1", "https://deadline.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/91505392821443878650ac82c7e33e6401197c55118ef53cbea88c7e8f4aa9f8.jpeg?resize=232,175", "https://www.indiewire.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/MCDAQUA_EC010.jpg?w=300&h=300&crop=1", "https://www.indiewire.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/ONCE-UPON-A-STUDIO-ONLINE-USE_01.0_006.00_0110.jpg?w=3000&h=1608&crop=1", "https://www.indiewire.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Taylor-Swift-1.jpg?w=300&h=300&crop=1"], "top_img": "https://www.indiewire.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/screen-shot-2018-01-16-at-10-40-59-am.png", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Zack Sharf"], "canonical_link": "https://www.indiewire.com/features/general/catherine-zeta-jones-michael-douglas-sexual-harassment-1201917639/", "title": "Catherine Zeta-Jones Stands By Michael Douglas After Preemptive Sexual Harassment Denial: \u2018There Was No Other Way\u2019", "meta_data": {"description": "The actress says \"there was no other way\" but for Douglas to come forward.", "robots": "max-image-preview:large", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=1400654071", "generator": "WordPress 6.2.3", "author": "Zack Sharf", "content_type": "Post", "post_id": 1201917639, "title": "Catherine Zeta-Jones Stands By Michael Douglas After Preemptive Sexual Harassment Denial: 'There Was No Other Way'", "published_at": "2018-01-16 10:56:56", "image": "https://www.indiewire.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/screen-shot-2018-01-16-at-10-40-59-am.png?w=300", "comment_count": 0, "tags": "Sexual Harassment", "topics": "General", "body": "Catherine Zeta-Jones is standing by husband Michael Douglas after he came forward to preemptively deny a sexual harassment claim set to be made against him.

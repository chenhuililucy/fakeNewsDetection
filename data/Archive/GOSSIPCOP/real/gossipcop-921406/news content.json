But, sleep easy, Jennifer Lawrence and all other concerned Kaylor fans: EVERYTHING IS OKAY. Really! Kloss just assured the New York Times!\n\nWhen the outlet asked her about the status of her and Swift's friendship in a new interview, Kloss replied, \u201cDon\u2019t believe everything you read.\" So, Kloss' \"Swish Swish\" caption and Perry hangout truly do mean nothing?\n\nThe NYT noted that Kloss and Swift \"continue to be good friends, and they talk frequently.\" Imagine all the laughing-cat emojis they texted when that first Kaylor is dead story went around. (Kloss may have just sent a standard laughing face since she's a dog person.) Maybe Swift really is just keeping her relationships private.\n\nMore From ELLE\n\nKloss also talked about her friendship with Serena Williams in much more expressive terms. \"Serena is one of the most extraordinary women on the planet,\u201d Kloss said. \u201cShe challenges the status quo in so many ways, and I learn from her constantly.\u201d\n\nHowever, Kloss would not talk about her other heavily-scrutinized relationship with boyfriend Joshua Kushner, the quiet March for Our Lives-donating, liberal brother of Trump senior advisor/son-in-law Jared Kushner. \u201cMy relationship has nothing to do with this interview,\u201d she said.

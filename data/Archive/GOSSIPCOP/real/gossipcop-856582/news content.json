Lewis began dating Pitt, who was 10 years her senior, at the age of 17. They were together for three years before splitting in 1993. Following their breakup, Lewis, who once deemed herself a \"heavy pothead,\" got deeper into drugs and began dabbling with painkillers and cocaine. She eventually entered a rehab program and has been sober since she was in her 20s.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn a new interview with People, Lewis admitted that most of the stories surrounding her were \"usually about Brad Pitt or drug addiction, which hasn't been me since I was 22.\"\n\n\"I'm 40. I quit all my bullshit at 22. There is growth. Get out of the past,\" Lewis explained. \"I used to be really insular, really introverted,\" she said. \"I couldn't articulate myself.\"\n\nLewis, who recently appeared in \"August: Osage County\" and is promoting two films, \"Kelly & Cat\" and \"Hellion,\" at SXSW arts festival in Austin, Texas, is trying not to let the past get the best of her. She's focused on work and is gearing up to release her fifth album.", "images": ["https://pixel.quantserve.com/pixel/p-3aud4J6uA4Z6Y.gif", "https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6723616&c3=&c4=&c5=&c6=&c15=&cj=1", "https://www.facebook.com/tr?id=1621685564716533&ev=PageView&noscript=1", "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/57d0672c180000b429bcfdf6.jpeg?ops=scalefit_960_noupscale", "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/default-entry.jpg?ops=1200_630"], "top_img": "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/default-entry.jpg?ops=1200_630", "keywords": [], "authors": [], "canonical_link": "https://www.huffpost.com/entry/juliette-lewis-brad-pitt-drug-addiction_n_4936884", "title": "Juliette Lewis On Brad Pitt Romance And Drug Addiction: 'I Quit All My Bulls--t At 22'", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, minimum-scale=1.0", "description": "Juliette Lewis Talks Brad Pitt, Says 'I Quit All My Bulls--t At 22'", "keywords": "juliette lewis brad pitt,juliette lewis brad pitt relationship,juliette lewis news,celebrity,juliette lewis interview,juliette lewis drugs,Video,juliette lewis drug addiction,juliette lewis august: osage county,juliette lewis,juliette lewis sxsw festival,juliette lewis kelly  cat,juliette lewis photos", "fb": {"app_id": 46744042133}, "og": {"title": "Juliette Lewis Talks Brad Pitt, Says 'I Quit All My Bulls--t At 22'", "type": "article", "image": {"identifier": "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/default-entry.jpg?ops=1200_630", "url": "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/default-entry.jpg?ops=1200_630", "type": "image/jpeg", "width": 1200, "height": 630}, "url": "https://www.huffpost.com/entry/juliette-lewis-brad-pitt-drug-addiction_n_4936884", "site_name": "HuffPost", "locale": "en_US", "description": "Juliette Lewis Talks Brad Pitt, Says 'I Quit All My Bulls--t At 22'"}, "article": {"tag": "juliette lewis brad pitt,juliette lewis brad pitt relationship,juliette lewis news,celebrity,juliette lewis interview,juliette lewis drugs,Video,juliette lewis drug addiction,juliette lewis august: osage county,juliette lewis,juliette lewis sxsw festival,juliette lewis kelly  cat,juliette lewis photos", "section": "Celebrity", "published_time": "2014-03-10T21:03:11Z", "modified_time": "2014-03-11T16:59:02Z"}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "site": "@HuffPostEnt", "title": "Juliette Lewis Talks Brad Pitt, Says 'I Quit All My Bulls--t At 22'", "image": {"identifier": "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/default-entry.jpg?ops=1200_630", "width": 1200, "height": 630}, "description": "Juliette Lewis Talks Brad Pitt, Says 'I Quit All My Bulls--t At 22'"}, "al": {"ios": {"url": "huffpostnews:///?editionID=us&entryID=us_5bb54292e4b0d5899c1799b5", "app_store_id": 306621789, "app_name": "HuffPost"}}, "robots": "max-snippet:-1,max-image-preview:large,max-video-preview:-1", "google-site-verification": "97Mj-wW7u8U1NOnkW1rfH-I1kgO0-a9YsgoesOk41R8"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1394380800.0, "source": "https://www.huffingtonpost.com", "summary": ""}

(That's one donation each for her, husband John Legend and their two children, Luna and Miles.)\n\n\u201cJohn and I are outraged to see and hear the horror stories of immigrant families seeking asylum and refuge in America being ripped apart due to the inhumane policies of the Trump administration,\" Teigen wrote. \"These actions are cruel, anti-family and go against everything we believe this country should represent.\"\n\nShe continued, \"On this auspicious occasion, in order to Make Trump\u2019s Birthday Great Again, each member of our family has donated $72,000 to the ACLU.\u201d\n\nShe encouraged her followers, \"Wish Donald a happy birthday with a donation to the ACLU,\" preferably in installments of \"$7.20, $72 or whatever you like.\"\n\nThe ACLU, founded in 1920, says its mission is to \"defend and preserve the individual rights and liberties guaranteed by the Constitution and laws of the United States.\"\n\nTeigen told USA TODAY last year that she's \"been a big Donald Trump hater (for a long time)\" and estimated that she had been \"trolling him for about 5 to 7 years now.\"\n\nLast month, that got easier for her: A federal court ruled the president cannot block critical followers from viewing his tweets.", "images": ["https://www.usatoday.com/gcdn/-mm-/60cb363194f6789a61fa595fe617302a2b8c65c7/c=0-1220-3443-3165/local/-/media/2018/05/14/USATODAY/usatsports/wp-USAT-allthemoms-front1-21830-chrissyteigen2.jpg?width=3200&height=1808&fit=crop&format=pjpg&auto=webp"], "top_img": "https://www.usatoday.com/gcdn/-mm-/60cb363194f6789a61fa595fe617302a2b8c65c7/c=0-1220-3443-3165/local/-/media/2018/05/14/USATODAY/usatsports/wp-USAT-allthemoms-front1-21830-chrissyteigen2.jpg?width=3200&height=1808&fit=crop&format=pjpg&auto=webp", "keywords": [], "authors": [], "canonical_link": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/life/entertainthis/2018/06/14/chrissy-teigen-announces-288-000-aclu-donation-protest-trump/702570002/", "title": "Chrissy Teigen makes Trump's birthday great by donating to ACLU in installments of $72K", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1,minimum-scale=1", "theme-color": "#0098FE", "og": {"title": "Chrissy Teigen makes Trump's birthday great by donating to ACLU in installments of $72K", "description": "Teigen announced via Twitter that she and husband John Legend were donating $72,000 per family member to the ACLU.

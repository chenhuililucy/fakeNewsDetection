But for Sex and the City fans, the night was something else entirely: a bitter reminder that underneath the sweet surface of that beloved franchise lurks something darker. I\u2019m talking, of course, about the ongoing feud between Sarah Jessica Parker and Kim Cattrall, which Kristin Davis may have inadvertently re-ignited during the ceremony with a seemingly pointed Instagram.\n\nDavis posted a photo of herself and her co-stars from the 2004 ceremony, writing, \u201cEmmy flashback\u2014super happy memories and wishing joy to everyone tonight. We are all so incredibly lucky to get to do what we do!\u201d The only problem? Though Parker and Cynthia Nixon were present and accounted for in the photo, Cattrall was missing. Coincidence? Fans thought not.\n\nInstagram content This content can also be viewed on the site it originates from.\n\nListen: it\u2019s entirely possible that Davis meant nothing by this. Nixon and Parker were, after all, the cast members who went home with gold statuettes during the 2004 Emmys, so it makes sense for Davis to have posed only with them. Still, it seems pretty unlikely that Davis was completely unaware of how it would look for her to post a photo that does not also picture Cattrall\u2014especially within the context of a cast feud that\u2019s been churning publicly for a year now. Besides, subtly leaving a shunned member of your social circle out of an Instagram post sounds like a total Charlotte move.\n\nThe rumored beef between Parker and Cattrall has sizzled for years\u2014allegedly dating back to the final season of Sex and the City, when Cattrall supposedly became angry over the pay gap between herself and Parker. Last year, tales of this feud of yore came to the fore again as news broke that Sex and the City 3 would never reach theaters\u2014and early rumors pointed to Cattrall as the cause. The film was all teed up until Cattrall allegedly refused to participate unless Warner Bros. pledged to make another one of her long-gestating projects. Cattrall, however, has insisted that she simply didn\u2019t want to be involved in the film.\n\nWillie Garson, who played Stanford Blatch on the series, was not shy about slamming Cattrall after she compared her experience with the show to a toxic relationship. \u201cDear fans, because I'm \u2018toxic,\u2019 I'm going to negotiate a contract for 6 months, not come to terms, then say I never wanted to do it anyway,\u201d he said. Cattrall later lashed out at Parker for offering her condolences following the death of Cattrall\u2019s brother. \u201cYour continuous reaching out is a painful reminder of how cruel you really were then and now,\u201d Cattrall wrote on Instagram. \u201cLet me make this VERY clear. (If I haven\u2019t already) You are not my family. You are not my friend. So I\u2019m writing to tell you one last time to stop exploiting our tragedy in order to restore your \u2018nice girl\u2019 persona.\u201d Jason Lewis, who played Samantha Jones\u2019s love interest on the show, surprisingly took Parker\u2019s side later that month. Nixon has, so far, done a pretty good job of staying neutral.\n\nWhich brings us back to Davis. While we can\u2019t say for sure if Davis meant anything deeper by her Instagram post, it\u2019s worth remembering that she\u2019s traditionally done a decent job herself of keeping things sunny when it comes to cast relationships and failed Sex and the City movie projects. So perhaps we should give her the benefit of the doubt here. But either way, it seems unlikely we\u2019ll see these four women reuniting for cupcakes at Magnolia Bakery anytime soon.", "images":

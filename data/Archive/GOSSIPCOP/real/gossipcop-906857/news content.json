As Prince William\u2019s brother Prince Harry is expecting his first child with Meghan Markle, bookies have slashed the odds on the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge expecting a baby as well. Bookies Coral have released odds over a sudden announcement from the future King and Queen of England as the odds now shows the chance of Kate being pregnant at 1/2 - a 50 percent chance.\n\nCoral's Harry Aitkenhead said: \"Our odds show that there's every chance that Kate and Wills might add to their growing family, and a fourth baby is certainly a possibility. \u201cWe've taken some bets over the last two weeks or so on it happening and there's a real buzz around the Royal family at the moment with Meghan expecting.\u201d But whether the Duchess of Cambridge will follow in the Queen\u2019s footstep by having four children is yet to be confirmed. One source has said he does not think Kate will have more children as he thinks \u201cKate is done\u201d after suffering extreme morning sickness throughout her three previous pregnancies.\n\nKate Middleton: The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge already have three children together\n\nKate Middleton pregnant: Prince William and Kate has three children together\n\nThe source told People magazine: \"I can\u2019t imagine Kate will want any more given the ordeal that she goes through every pregnancy. \u201cI should think that three children is enough.\" A source also told Express.co.uk the Duchess had to convince Prince William to have a third child, because she \"always wanted more than two children\". The source said: \u201dAs one of three, Kate wanted at least three.\n\nSUBSCRIBE Invalid email We use your sign-up to provide content in ways you've consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

two, but because George was quite a difficult baby. \"Then they had Charlotte and she was a lot easier. \u201cNow the idea of a newborn doesn\u2019t seem half as challenging.\" The royal couple is also thought to already have their hands full with taking care of Prince George, Princess Charlotte and Prince Louis.\n\nKate Middleton returns from maternity leave to visit school\n\nKate and Prince

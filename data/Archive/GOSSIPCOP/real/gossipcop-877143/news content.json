Over the course of the week, the organization has rescued over 200 dogs, cats and other pets, working to find them food and shelter.\n\nThe effort began on Monday, when trucks from the foundation left for Houston to start the rescue mission.\n\n\"It was important to our AMAZING founder, @mirandalambert that we do our part for her home state!\" MuttNation Foundation wrote on Instagram.\n\nLambert joined the team to help with relief efforts, and has posted social media updates throughout the week. On Tuesday, she shared that they had rescued 72 dogs, and on Wednesday, she said they sent 70 to safe shelters.\n\n\"My roommates tonight!\" she captioned a photo full of puppies. \"Mama & newborns born this morning. @Mutt_Nation rescued 72 dogs today who are being transported to dry safe shelters.\"\n\nBillie Joe Armstrong also tweeted in support of Lambert and MuttNation Foundation.\n\n\"Follow @MuttNation. this is my good friend Miranda Lambert's foundation. Finding homes for lost dogs from Texas flood,\" he wrote.\n\nLambert posted a photo with one of the dogs Thursday, promising an additional progress update coming soon.", "images": ["https://www.usatoday.com/gcdn/-mm-/13e91021ee7e2fe7c62a54fe4ec9f15d9f63fecc/c=0-0-2996-1693/local/-/media/2017/09/01/USATODAY/USATODAY/636398538576071535-GTY-693843852.jpg?width=2996&height=1693&fit=crop&format=pjpg&auto=webp"], "top_img": "https://www.usatoday.com/gcdn/-mm-/13e91021ee7e2fe7c62a54fe4ec9f15d9f63fecc/c=0-0-2996-1693/local/-/media/2017/09/01/USATODAY/USATODAY/636398538576071535-GTY-693843852.jpg?width=2996&height=1693&fit=crop&format=pjpg&auto=webp", "keywords": [], "authors": [], "canonical_link": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/life/entertainthis/2017/09/01/hurricane-harvey-miranda-lambert-helps-rescue-hundreds-dogs-and-pets/624244001/", "title": "Hurricane Harvey: Miranda Lambert helps rescue hundreds of dogs and pets", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1,minimum-scale=1", "theme-color": "#0098FE", "og": {"title": "Hurricane Harvey: Miranda Lambert helps rescue hundreds of dogs and pets", "description": "The singer is using her charity MuttNation to help dogs and other pets in Houston who were displaced by the natural disaster.", "url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/life/entertainthis/2017/09/01/hurricane-harvey-miranda-lambert-helps-rescue-hundreds-dogs-and-pets/624244001/", "site_name": "USA TODAY", "image": {"identifier": "https://www.usatoday.com/gcdn/-mm-/13e91021ee7e2fe7c62a54fe4ec9f15d9f63fecc/c=0-0-2996-1693/local/-/media/2017/09/01/USATODAY/USATODAY/636398538576071535-GTY-693843852.jpg?width=2996&height=1693&fit=crop&format=pjpg&auto=webp", "width": 2996, "height": 1693}, "type": "article"}, "article": {"author": "Brooke Metz", "content_tier": "free", "opinion": "false"}, "description": "The singer is using her charity MuttNation to help dogs and other pets in Houston who were displaced by the natural disaster.", "fb": {"pages": "13652355666,48958576760,156345381090801,110471702456365,6566864515,137698179626815,315942225236045,927427260614748,183850168300771,1443524575938047,251228454889939,158095147555989,115535341805950,236655713446291,1621466394844549,250325640686,177037772444433,1972936962947967,2047091012096533,535551216797440", "app_id": 215046668549694}, "ROBOTS": "NOODP, NOYDIR, max-image-preview:large", "google": "notranslate", "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "image": "https://www.usatoday.com/gcdn/-mm-/13e91021ee7e2fe7c62a54fe4ec9f15d9f63fecc/c=0-0-2996-1693/local/-/media/2017/09/01/USATODAY/USATODAY/636398538576071535-GTY-693843852.jpg?width=1600&height=800&fit=crop&format=pjpg&auto=webp", "site": "@usatoday", "creator": "@usatoday", "title": "Hurricane Harvey: Miranda Lambert helps rescue hundreds of dogs and pets", "description": "The singer is using her charity MuttNation to help dogs and other pets in Houston who were displaced by the natural disaster."}}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1504195200.0, "source": "https://www.usatoday.com", "summary": ""}

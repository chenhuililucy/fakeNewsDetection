He beat out competition like Daniel Kaluuya in \u201cGet Out\u201d and Timoth\u00e9e Chalamet in \u201cCall Me By Your Name,\u201d who was set become the youngest Best Actor honoree in almost 80 years.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cMovies, such is their power, captivated a young man from south London and gave him a dream,\u201d he said onstage in his acceptance speech before thanking his mother. \u201cPut the kettle on, I\u2019m bringing Oscar home.\u201d\n\nGary Oldman and Gisele Schmidt arrive for the 90th Annual Academy Awards. VALERIE MACON via Getty Images\n\nOldman\u2019s win arrives amid a growing backlash against the actor, as allegations of domestic violence against him have resurfaced. The English actor was accused of choking and beating his then-wife Donya Fiorentino in 2001 with a telephone while their young children watched.\n\nThe police investigated Fiorentino\u2019s claims and charges were never filed, with Oldman describing her account as \u201creplete with lies, innuendos and half-truths.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nPeople watching along immediately reacted on Twitter to Oldman\u2019s win, as well as to accused rapist Kobe Bryant\u2019s, who picked up an Oscar for Best Animated Short Film.\n\nGuess Time isn't up for Gary either. \u2014 roxane gay (@rgay) March 5, 2018\n\n\"Time's Up! Well, except for Kobe, and Seacrest, and Gary Oldman later tonight!\" \u2014 Kevin T. Paddington (@KevinTPorter) March 5, 2018\n\nOh, Hollywood.

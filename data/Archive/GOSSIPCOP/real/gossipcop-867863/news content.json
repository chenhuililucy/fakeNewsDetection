In addition to supporting her husband, Asiah keeps busy by raising their 1-year-old daughter, Aislin, and working on her own dreams.\n\n\n\n\"Oh my God, I'm still trying to figure that out,\" Asiah said, when asked how she balances it all in this industry. \"Sometimes it gets really tricky, but most of the time it's just about having a really good support system.\"\n\n\n\n\"But I'm excited for fans to learn that I do have a brain and a personality and I'm out here making moves,\" she added. \"Also, just more about the roles that I play on tour, helping Ink out. I'm not only there to be a pretty face -- I'm actually contributing to the tour, handling the merch, etc. Anything he needs me to do, I'll do it. It doesn't matter what it is.\"\n\n\n\nAsiah confirmed her and Ink's baby girl will make a few appearances on the show. She says their lives have changed drastically since welcoming a child, and fans will get to see a part of that world.\n\n\n\n\"You have to keep it fresh,\" she said of how she and Ink have made it work all these years. \"We both get so busy, and having a toddler now as well, it's just knowing that you don't always have the proper time to be intimate. So, you just get it in when you can and how you can. We also plan date nights. Every Wednesday night we'll go somewhere, just the two of us.\"\n\n\n\nAlthough they seemingly have their hands full already, Asiah said she and Ink are currently \"trying\" for another kid.\n\n\n\n\"I have it on my mind. I've mapped it out to wait until after my 30th birthday next year,\" Asiah, who celebrated her 29th birthday on the day of our interview, revealed. \"So, the plan is in a year to get knocked up the night of my 30th birthday. But we've both been feeling the fever a lot lately. So, we'll see if we last that long.\"", "images": ["https://web.archive.org/web/20171013231201im_/http://www.etonline.com/sites/default/files/styles/max_1280x720/public/images/2017-10/z_theplatinumlife_ladies.jpg?itok=AUEHQN3c", "https://web.archive.org/web/20171013231201im_/http://www.etonline.com/sites/default/files/images/2017-10/1280_rs_634x950-171009154039-634-the-platinum-life-alycia-bella-1.jpg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20171013231201im_/http://www.etonline.com/sites/default/files/images/2017-10/1280_rs_634x950-171009154041-634-the-platinum-life-shantel-jackson-1.jpg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20171013231201im_/http://www.etonline.com/sites/default/files/images/2017-10/1280_rs_634x950-171009154037-634-the-platinum-life-asiah-collins.jpg"], "top_img": "https://web.archive.org/web/20171013231201im_/http://www.etonline.com/sites/default/files/styles/max_1280x720/public/images/2017-10/z_theplatinumlife_ladies.jpg?itok=AUEHQN3c", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Desiree Murphy"], "canonical_link": "https://web.archive.org/web/20171013231201/http://www.etonline.com/ladies-platinum-life-talk-love-heartbreak-drama-new-reality-series-exclusive-89184", "title": "The Ladies of 'The Platinum Life' Talk Love, Heartbreak & Drama on New Reality Series (Exclusive)", "meta_data": {"title": "The Ladies of 'The Platinum Life' Talk Love, Heartbreak & Drama on New Reality Series (Exclusive) | Entertainment Tonight", "fb": {"pages": 106843036179, "admins": 3111204, "app_id": 145337045558621}, "og": {"site_name": "Entertainment Tonight", "type": "Article", "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20171013231201/http://www.etonline.com/ladies-platinum-life-talk-love-heartbreak-drama-new-reality-series-exclusive-89184", "title": "The Ladies of 'The Platinum Life' Talk Love, Heartbreak & Drama on New Reality Series (Exclusive)", "description": "Ahead of Sunday's premiere, the queens of the hip-hop scene explain what they hope fans will learn about them!", "image": "https://web.archive.org/web/20171013231201im_/http://www.etonline.com/sites/default/files/styles/max_1280x720/public/images/2017-10/z_theplatinumlife_ladies.jpg?itok=AUEHQN3c"}, "robots": "index", "apple-mobile-web-app-capable": "yes", "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "title": "The Ladies of 'The Platinum Life' Talk Love, Heartbreak & Drama on New Reality Series (Exclusive)", "description": "Ahead of Sunday's premiere, the queens of the hip-hop scene explain what they hope fans will learn about them!", "site": {"identifier": "@etnow", "id": 23603092}, "creator": "Desiree Murphy\u200d", "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20171013231201im_/http://www.etonline.com/ladies-platinum-life-talk-love-heartbreak-drama-new-reality-series-exclusive-89184", "image": "https://web.archive.org/web/20171013231201im_/http://www.etonline.com/sites/default/files/styles/max_1280x720/public/images/2017-10/z_theplatinumlife_ladies.jpg?itok=AUEHQN3c"}, "description": "Ahead of Sunday's premiere, the queens of the hip-hop scene explain what they hope fans will learn about them!", "msvalidate.01": "DC10472F438B55F3A58638BC31271706", "google-site-verification": "hKpIt34FKZ_qMU81xUdLUw2YzuyZY1pS76p0622Hc7w", "Generator": "Drupal 8 (https://www.drupal.org)", "MobileOptimized": "width", "HandheldFriendly": "true", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, minimum-scale=1.0"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": null, "source": "https://web.archive.org", "summary": ""}

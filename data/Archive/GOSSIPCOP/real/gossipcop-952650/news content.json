Which is kind of odd since I thought I already saw her modeling in last year\u2019s issue. Oh yeah, I did.\n\nAnyhoo, regardless of how you slice it, Kostek has been \u201cofficially\u201d named a 2019 Sports Illustrated Swimsuit model and rookie and her boyfriend Rob Gronkowski couldn\u2019t be more proud of her.\n\n\u201cIt feels just unreal to say my girl is a Sports Illustrated Swimsuit model,\u201d said the Patriots tight end. \u201cIt\u2019s just unreal the work she\u2019s been putting in and the workouts she\u2019s been doing to stay in shape\u2026 to keep the booty juicy! She\u2019s always been putting in the work and always the time, and she definitely deserves it.\n\n\u201cCamille has been working her whole life to get in the SI Swimsuit issue,\u201d Gronk continued. \u201cEver since we met she\u2019s been talking about, every single day basically\u2026 When she got the news she told me all about it. I couldn\u2019t be more excited for her.\u201d\n\nThe 26-year-old Kostek was also pretty fired up.\n\nApparently, part of her preparation for her upcoming her rookie spread on Kangaroo Island in South Australia involved working out with her guy, reports Sports Illustrated.\n\nSo we headed back to the home of her boyfriend, known by the world as \u201cGronk,\u201d to see what a training session between the happy couple looks like. And let us just tell you, he did not cut any corners for his girl!\n\n[protected-iframe id=\u201dc9830180a33d4615e6922639b896a898-97886205-92827192\u2033 info=\u201d//players.brightcove.net/2157889318001/default_default/index.html?videoId=5852102066001\u2033 width=\u201d640\u2033 height=\u201d360\u2033 frameborder=\u201d0\u2033 allowfullscreen=\u201d\u201d]\n\n\n\n\u201cWhen I workout alone, as opposed to with Rob, I\u2019m so much more motivated,\u201d Camille said after the grueling session. \u201cHis work ethic is super strong. His endurance exceeds mine so it sets the standard really high\u2026I don\u2019t want to move on to the next workout until I can get at least half the speed or one rep that is the speed he was at.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis time last year I was shooting for Sports Illustrated Swimsuit 2018 in Belize as one of the final 6 finalists for #SIswimsearch,\u201d Kostek wrote on Instagram. \u201cMy bags are packed as I head to South Australia as not only a 2019 official Rookie, but as the first up to shoot for the @si_swimsuit 2019 issue!! My excitement will never dull for each time I pack my bags to work with this team. I\u2019ve told you 100 times and I\u2019ll say it again and again\u2026.Chase your dreams my friends, it\u2019s a feeling that makes you feel alive on the journey and complete euphoria once you get there. IT\u2019S GO TIME.\u201d\n\nChase those dreams, bros. And date someone famous. But yeah, chase those dreams.", "images": ["https://brobible.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/rob-gronkowski-reaction-girlfriend-si-swimsuit.jpg?quality=90&w=650", "https://brobible.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/connor-toole-brobible-avatar-headshot.png?w=50", "https://brobible.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/taylorswift34.png?w=256&h=144&crop=1", "https://brobible.com/wp-content/themes/brobible/assets/images/icons/google-news-icon.svg", "https://brobible.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/traviskelce3.png?w=354&h=199&crop=1", "https://brobible.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/taylor-swift-deadpool-3.jpg?w=256&h=144&crop=1", "https://brobible.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/rob-gronkowski-reaction-girlfriend-si-swimsuit.jpg", "https://brobible.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/cass-anderson-brobible-headshot.jpg?w=50", "https://brobible.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/grayson-weir-avatar.jpeg?w=50", "https://brobible.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/jacob-elsey-brobible-avatar.jpg?w=32", "https://brobible.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/doug-sheckler-headshot.jpg?w=40", "https://brobible.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/clay-sauertieg-brobible-avatar.jpeg?w=38", "https://brobible.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/taylorswift34.png?w=300", "https://brobible.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/britney-spears-glaad-awards-red-carpet.png?w=256&h=144&crop=1", "https://brobible.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/dov-kleiman.png?w=50", "https://brobible.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Huckberry_Schott-Leather-Jackets_Featured.jpg?w=256&h=144&crop=1", "https://brobible.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/yeti-cocktail-shaker-7.jpg?w=256&h=144&crop=1", "https://brobible.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Macys_Nike_adidas_Sneaker-Sale_Oct-2023_Featured.jpg?w=256&h=144&crop=1", "https://brobible.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/deionsanders21.png?w=354&h=199&crop=1", "https://brobible.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/ninaagdal2.png?w=256&h=144&crop=1", "https://brobible.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/ninaagdal2.png?w=300", "https://brobible.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Chargers-Fan.jpg?w=354&h=199&crop=1", "https://brobible.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/eric-italiano.jpg?w=50", "https://brobible.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/jorge-alonso-brobible-headshot.jpg?w=42", "https://brobible.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/doug-sheckler-headshot.jpg?w=69", "https://brobible.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/traviskelce3.png?w=300", "https://brobible.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Caleb-Williams.jpg?w=256&h=144&crop=1", "https://brobible.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/tom-conroy-brobible-avatar.jpg?w=33", "https://brobible.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/traviskelce3.png?w=256&h=144&crop=1", "https://brobible.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Twitter-X.jpg?w=256&h=144&crop=1", "https://brobible.com/wp-content/themes/brobible/assets/images/logo.svg", "https://brobible.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/hot-peppers.jpg?w=256&h=144&crop=1", "https://brobible.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Twitter-X.jpg?w=300", "https://brobible.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Huckberry_Schott-Leather-Jackets_Featured.jpg?w=354&h=199&crop=1", "https://brobible.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/garrett-carr-brobible-avatar.jpg?w=38", "https://brobible.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Geologie_Try-Before-You-Buy_Haircare_Featured.jpg?w=256&h=144&crop=1"], "top_img": "https://brobible.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/rob-gronkowski-reaction-girlfriend-si-swimsuit.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Douglas Charles", "Jorge Alonso", "Dov Kleiman", "Tom Conroy", "Before Settling Down At Brobible", "A Graduate Of The University Of Iowa", "Go Hawks", "Owned", "Operated A Wide Assortment Of Websites.

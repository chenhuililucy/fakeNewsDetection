Case in point: This weekend, New Yorker writer Hannah Goldfield intercepted an accidental leak of a guest notes spreadsheet from an unnamed celebrity hot spot, and many of these notes are hilariously strange.\n\nSoothing my anxiety by slowly savoring this spreadsheet of notes on customers that a restaurant accidentally attached to an email blast pic.twitter.com/X4oXBXPqpY \u2014 Hannah Goldfield (@hannahgoldfield) July 7, 2017\n\nHere are a few takeaways from this epic Twitter thread:\n\nGoldfield remarks that this spreadsheet has over 30,000 notes on guests. The identity of the restaurant remains a mystery, but if you have any guesses \u2014 or any other great stories about POS notes concerning celebrities and/or wannabe VIPs \u2014 please share them in the comments of this post.\n\n\u2022 @hannagoldfied [Twitter]\n\n\u2022 All Pop Culture Coverage [E]", "images":

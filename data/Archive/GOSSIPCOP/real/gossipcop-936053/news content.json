I'm not myself anymore. I\u2019m just too nervous\".'\n\n\n\nThe 36-year-old sports star - who had welcomed her first child with Reddit co-founder Ohanian just two months before their wedding - managed to remain calm and sympathetic.\n\nShe wrote back and said: 'Daddy, it's okay, if you don't want to come to the wedding at all, that's okay too. I'm not going to be upset with you about it, so I don't want you to be upset about it.'\n\n\n\nGetty Images\n\nSerena added that while Richard's health is better now, at the time he wasn't feeling good about himself, and although many daughters may have reacted differently, all she wanted was for her family to be happy.\n\n'Maybe a lot of daughters wouldn't react the same way, but I know the struggles he\u2019s had these last few years,' she reflected.\n\nGetty Images\n\n'His health is better now, but I know he still doesn\u2019t feel like himself, doesn\u2019t feel like he's perfect. And if he doesn\u2019t want to be up there in front of a lot of people, I completely understand.\n\n'Look, when we first came on the scene, there were a lot of people who didn\u2019t get him. I don\u2019t think a lot of them wanted to get him.\n\nGetty Images\n\n'I don\u2019t think a lot of him could have anyway. Our family knows what we have. We just want each other to be happy. That's what matters. I don\u2019t think anything could ever change that.'\n\n\n\nSerena - the greatest female athlete in the world - walked down the aisle by herself, with her daughter Alexis looking on from the front row.\n\nBeing Serena chronicles the star's pregnancy, difficult birth, marriage to Ohanian, and her successful return to tennis.\n\nMeanwhile, Serena is believed to be attending Meghan's wedding to Prince Harry this weekend in Windsor.\n\nThe royal wedding has been marred by family drama. It was recently reported that former lighting director wouldn't be able to attend as he had to undergo a heart procedure this week.\n\nMeghan Markle has now confirmed that her father won't be attending the ceremony, but he had previously said he would be there to walk his daughter down the aisle - health permitting.\n\nGetty Images\n\nThe furore began when it was alleged that Thomas had staged recent paparazzi photos, which had left him feeling 'deeply embarrassed'. However, certain press outlets had been writing disparaging articles about him and his Mexico home, and it appeared as though he had been harassed by photographers.\n\nIn his absence, it's believed Meghan's mother Doria Ragland will walk Meghan down the aisle, which royal expert Penny Junor said would be 'enormously touching'.\n\nIt would also be a nice gesture towards gender equality, with Meghan being a vocal feminist and women's rights advocate.\n\nOur thoughts go out to the Markles and the Royal Family during this difficult time.", "images":

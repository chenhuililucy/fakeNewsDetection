They\u2019ve had time away from each other now, so they know the importance of one another, the weight of them being separated. They really miss each other.\u201d\n\nAWWWWW!\n\nHe adds that the two characters have one of the truest friendships: \u201cI think that\u2019s like whenever I have a really good friend and we don\u2019t see each other for a long time, and then when we see each other again it\u2019s like not a day has gone by without seeing each other. I feel like that really solidifies an adult friendship.\u201d\n\n\u201c\u2018Cause like when we\u2019re kids, we\u2019re inseparable because we\u2019re in a small town and all we have is each other, but once we expand and grow up and start to live our adult lives, but still keep in touch, I think that\u2019s what really like solidifies an adult friendship, and so you kind of get to see Scott and Stiles as adults.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s making me emotional talking about it a little bit!\u201d Tyler confessed. Us too!\n\nHe adds, \u201cYou really get to see them grow up like you have ever year, but there\u2019s definitely a different dynamic now. They\u2019re growing up and it\u2019s really cool to see.\u201d", "images": ["https://cdn.justjaredjr.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/scott-stiles/thumbs/scott-stiles-miss-each-other-teen-wolf-01.jpg", "https://cdn.justjaredjr.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/scott-stiles/thumbs/scott-stiles-miss-each-other-teen-wolf-03.jpg", "https://cdn.justjaredjr.com/wp-content/uploads/headlines/2023/10/timothee-chalamet-on-the-kardashians2.jpg", "https://cdn.justjaredjr.com/wp-content/themes/justjaredjr/images/jr-circle-logo.gif", "https://cdn.justjaredjr.com/img/slides/button_play.gif", "https://cdn.justjaredjr.com/wp-content/uploads/headlines/2017/08/scott-stiles-miss-each-other-teen-wolf.jpg", "https://cdn.justjaredjr.com/wp-content/uploads/headlines/2023/03/lucy-hale-ashley-benson-troian-bellisario-have-pretty-little-liars-reunion.jpg", "https://cdn.justjaredjr.com/wp-content/themes/justjaredjr/images/jj-circle-logo-new.gif", "https://cdn.justjaredjr.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/scott-stiles/thumbs/scott-stiles-miss-each-other-teen-wolf-02.jpg", "https://cdn.justjaredjr.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/scott-stiles/thumbs/scott-stiles-miss-each-other-teen-wolf-05.jpg", "https://cdn.justjaredjr.com/wp-content/themes/justjaredjr/images/sidebar-twitter-button.gif", "https://cdn.justjaredjr.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/scott-stiles/thumbs/scott-stiles-miss-each-other-teen-wolf-04.jpg", "https://cdn.justjaredjr.com/wp-content/uploads/headlines/2023/08/have-we-been-getting-marios-famous-phrase-all-along-viral-tiktok-suggests-so.jpg", "https://cdn.justjaredjr.com/wp-content/themes/justjaredjr/images/sidebar-facebook-button.gif", "https://pixel.quantserve.com/pixel/p-2bXhGE9g7fCno.gif", "https://cdn.justjaredjr.com/wp-content/themes/justjaredjr/images/jr-mini-circle.png", "https://cdn.justjaredjr.com/wp-content/uploads/headlines/2023/10/robert-pattinson-twilight-auditions.jpg", "https://cdn.justjaredjr.com/wp-content/uploads/headlines/2017/08/scott-stiles.jpg", "https://cdn.justjaredjr.com/img/slides/button_reverse.gif", "https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=7&c2=31732370&c3=7894562878728989&cv=2.0&cj=1", "https://cdn.justjaredjr.com/wp-content/uploads/headlines/2023/07/drake-looks-back-on-his-degrassi-audition.jpg"], "top_img": "https://cdn.justjaredjr.com/wp-content/uploads/headlines/2017/08/scott-stiles.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": [], "canonical_link": "https://www.justjaredjr.com/2017/08/18/scott-stiles-really-miss-each-other-on-teen-wolf-tyler-posey-says/", "title": "Scott & Stiles Really Miss Each Other on 'Teen Wolf', Tyler Posey Says", "meta_data": {"description": "Scott & Stiles Really Miss Each Other on \u2018Teen Wolf\u2019, Tyler Posey Says Scott and Stiles are forever going to be the only real 'ship that we care about on Teen Wolf.

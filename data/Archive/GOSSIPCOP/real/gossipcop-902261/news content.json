One Direction\u2019s Liam Payne has announced that his girlfriend, singer Cheryl Cole (of Girls Aloud and X Factor judging fame), has given birth to their first child, an unnamed baby boy, earlier this week. \u201cMy close friends and family know there are very few times when I\u2019m left speechless \u2026 wow!\u201d he wrote on Instagram. \u201cI\u2019m incredibly happy to welcome our new baby boy into the world, it\u2019s a moment that I will never forget for the rest of my life and my favourite memory I have so far.\u201d Cole added on her own Instagram: \u201cAlthough he still doesn\u2019t have a name he is already stealing hearts. We are all madly in love and overwhelmingly happy with our little arrival.\u201d He\u2019ll be effortlessly crooning to some Girls Aloud classics by next week, we\u2019re sure.\n\n", "images": ["https://assets.nymag.com/media/components/customer-alert-banner/alert.svg", "https://pyxis.nymag.com/v1/imgs/87c/dd3/ef3556ac1227dd12db649cdde919152e98-26-payne.1x.rsocial.w1200.png", "https://pyxis.nymag.com/v1/imgs/fd1/2c2/0cceaf7f8ea65d263a2a1419e4776b9965-2123Cov-4x5-GOP-Primary.w240.jpg", "https://pyxis.nymag.com/v1/imgs/8df/879/45409a2249f67ed3cddf3f0df1579b35f9-teens-antiaging-skincare.2x.rsquare-zoom.w75.jpg", "https://assets.nymag.com/media/components/customer-alert-banner/double_chevron.svg", "https://pyxis.nymag.com/v1/imgs/2a4/8ab/010772040d8f9a0cbc6c42e9492cd1fd0a-DevonIvieFINAL--1-.2x.rsquare.w168.jpg", "https://pyxis.nymag.com/v1/imgs/5c0/935/de88b18067b9ca9b0c3748cf0b91ea97cc-passages-back-1.2x.rsquare-zoom.w75.jpg", "https://pyxis.nymag.com/v1/imgs/305/4b0/de42bd377c2dfcff8887b3311621dd8921-Esther.2x.rsquare-zoom.w75.jpg ", "https://pyxis.nymag.com/v1/imgs/87c/dd3/ef3556ac1227dd12db649cdde919152e98-26-payne.rsquare.w330.png", "https://assets.nymag.com/media/components/customer-alert-banner/close_x.svg"], "top_img": "https://pyxis.nymag.com/v1/imgs/87c/dd3/ef3556ac1227dd12db649cdde919152e98-26-payne.1x.rsocial.w1200.png", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Devon Ivie", "A Staff Writer Covering Classic Rock"], "canonical_link": "https://www.vulture.com/2017/03/one-directions-liam-payne-is-a-father-see-the-first-photo.html", "title": "One Direction's Liam Payne Is a Father; See the First Photo", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1,shrink-to-fit=no", "parsely-tags": "liam payne, one direction, cheryl cole, oh baby!, music, babies, featuretype:news-aggregation", "og": {"title": "One Direction\u2019s Liam Payne Is a Father; See the First Photo", "url": "https://www.vulture.com/2017/03/one-directions-liam-payne-is-a-father-see-the-first-photo.html", "description": "Oh, baby!", "image": "https://pyxis.nymag.com/v1/imgs/87c/dd3/ef3556ac1227dd12db649cdde919152e98-26-payne.1x.rsocial.w1200.png", "site_name": "Vulture", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"title": "One Direction\u2019s Liam Payne Is a Father; See the First Photo", "description": "Oh, baby!", "image": "https://pyxis.nymag.com/v1/imgs/87c/dd3/ef3556ac1227dd12db649cdde919152e98-26-payne.2x.rsocial.w600.png", "card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@devonsaysrelax", "site": "@vulture"}, "description": "Oh, baby!", "robots": "max-image-preview:large", "article": {"tag": "liam payne, one direction, cheryl cole, oh baby!, music, babies", "publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/Vulture"}, "sailthru.tags": "liam payne, one direction, cheryl cole, oh baby!, music, babies", "author": "Devon Ivie", "fb": {"app_id": 158902697551841}, "type": "Article", "vertical": "Vulture", "sectionOverride": "Vulture", "apple-mobile-web-app-title": "Vulture", "application-name": "Vulture", "msapplication-TileColor": "#00bcf1", "msapplication-TileImage": "https://assets.vulture.com/media/sites/vulture/icon.144x144.png"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": null, "source": "https://www.vulture.com", "summary": ""}

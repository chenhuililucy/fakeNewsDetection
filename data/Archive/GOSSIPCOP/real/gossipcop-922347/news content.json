In an occasional bit, he has appeared on the program to finish Fallon\u2019s monologue. This time Leno took aim at Steven Seagal, Kevin Spacey and others facing sexual misconduct accusations.\n\nRiffing on allegations that Charlie Rose exposed himself to female staffers, Leno tried to envision Walter Cronkite doing the same to former British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher.", "images": ["https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/564a20d81600002d0026d730.jpeg?ops=scalefit_960_noupscale", "https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6723616&c3=&c4=&c5=&c6=&c15=&cj=1", "https://pixel.quantserve.com/pixel/p-3aud4J6uA4Z6Y.gif", "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5ab373371f0000260616b1d6.png?ops=1200_630", "https://www.facebook.com/tr?id=1621685564716533&ev=PageView&noscript=1", "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5cd400b62100005900d41396.jpg?ops=100_100", "data:image/png;base64,iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAAAAEAAAABCAQAAAC1HAwCAAAAC0lEQVR42mNkYAAAAAYAAjCB0C8AAAAASUVORK5CYII="], "top_img": "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5ab373371f0000260616b1d6.png?ops=1200_630", "keywords": [], "authors": ["General Assignment Reporter"], "canonical_link": "https://www.huffpost.com/entry/jay-leno-monologue-jimmy-fallon_n_5ab370aae4b054d118dfbfbb", "title": "Jay Leno Takes Over 'Tonight Show' Monologue To Tell Sexual Harassment Jokes", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, minimum-scale=1.0", "description": "The former 'Tonight Show' host returned once again to do his shtick.", "keywords": "Arts and Entertainment,Celebrities,Jimmy Fallon,the tonight show,charlie rose,Jay Leno,monologue,Shtick", "fb": {"app_id": 46744042133}, "og": {"title": "Jay Leno Takes Over 'Tonight Show' Monologue To Tell Sexual Harassment Jokes", "type": "article", "image": {"identifier": "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5ab373371f0000260616b1d6.png?ops=1200_630", "url": "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5ab373371f0000260616b1d6.png?ops=1200_630", "type": "image/png", "width": 1200, "height": 630}, "url": "https://www.huffpost.com/entry/jay-leno-monologue-jimmy-fallon_n_5ab370aae4b054d118dfbfbb", "site_name": "HuffPost", "locale": "en_US", "description": "The former 'Tonight Show' host returned once again to do his shtick."}, "article": {"tag": "Arts and Entertainment,Celebrities,Jimmy Fallon,the tonight show,charlie rose,Jay Leno,monologue,Shtick", "section": "Comedy", "published_time": "2018-03-22T10:58:33Z", "modified_time": "2018-03-22T14:11:46Z"}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "site": "@HuffPostComedy", "title": "Jay Leno Takes Over 'Tonight Show' Monologue To Tell Sexual Harassment Jokes", "image": {"identifier": "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5ab373371f0000260616b1d6.png?ops=1200_630", "width": 1200, "height": 630}, "description": "The former 'Tonight Show' host returned once again to do his shtick."}, "al": {"ios": {"url": "huffpostnews:///?editionID=us&entryID=us_5ab370aae4b054d118dfbfbb", "app_store_id": 306621789, "app_name": "HuffPost"}}, "robots": "max-snippet:-1,max-image-preview:large,max-video-preview:-1", "google-site-verification": "97Mj-wW7u8U1NOnkW1rfH-I1kgO0-a9YsgoesOk41R8"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1521716313.0, "source": "https://www.huffingtonpost.com", "summary": ""}

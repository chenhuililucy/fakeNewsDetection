This marks the first time in eight years of the show that Kim won\u2019t appear as a cast member. The 53-year-old hasn\u2019t been a full-time \u201cHousewife\u201d since season five, but appeared in a \u201cguest\u201d capacity during seasons six and seven. She arguably delivered season seven\u2019s most intense moment, dramatically returning a gift Lisa Rinna bought for Kim\u2019s grandson at the season seven reunion.\n\n\u201cYou know, she's got a lot of stuff going on in her personal life,\u201d Kyle shares. \u201cShe, I think, didn't want to do that \u2026 maybe it's a little too intense, so she's happy doing what she's doing right now.\u201d\n\nKim is, of course, focused on her continued sobriety -- and her absence will be addressed this season. Still, her void is felt across the group.\n\n\u201cI think [it\u2019s] a shame, really,\u201d Lisa Vanderpump tells ET. \u201cBecause, always the relationship, when it's a family member, it really raises the stakes, because you're so invested in that. And I like Kim ... she stepped out at certain times, she's needed to step out, and it was a shame she didn't come back this year, because apparently, she's doing, you know, quite well.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt is weird,\u201d Kyle says of filming without Kim. \u201cYou know, we started it together and even though we fought, we're sisters and I love her. There's nothing like having your sister there with you, even if you're fighting -- that's your blood, so it's like, it was kind of weird at first.\u201d\n\n\u201cThere were times I really wanted her to be there this season, but she opted not to,\u201d she adds.\n\nStill, there is a silver lining for the sisters: no more fighting in front of reality TV cameras. Kyle admits she considered walking away from the show because of the strain it put on her and Kim\u2019s relationship.\n\n\u201cThat created so much anxiety for me,\u201d she says. \u201cJust a very difficult, emotional time and I just thought, 'This is not what I thought the show was going to be.' I thought it was gonna be all fun and games, I don't want to do this, but you know, you find the good outweighs the bad, and a lot of good has come from doing the Housewives. I'm doing things that I would've never been given the opportunity if it wasn't for the Housewives.\u201d\n\nThe Real Housewives of Beverly Hills returns for season eight on Tuesday, Dec. 19, at 9 p.m. ET on Bravo.", "images": ["http://content.tegna-media.com/photo/2017/12/15/et_hhh_kyle_richards_on_kim_121417_11949137_ver1.0.jpg", "https://www.wkyc.com/assets/shared-images/logos/native/wkyc.svg", "https://media.wkyc.com/assets/KPNX/images/c98095e4-30df-4d70-8956-2e3e97de46f5/c98095e4-30df-4d70-8956-2e3e97de46f5_16x9.jpg", "https://www.wkyc.com/assets/shared-images/icons/twitter.svg", "https://www.wkyc.com/assets/shared-images/weather-icons/cloudy-night_210x210.png", "https://www.wkyc.com/assets/shared-images/icons/facebook.svg", "https://media.wkyc.com/assets/WKYC/images/ad507b9c-626e-4127-a792-c07d265b4d70/ad507b9c-626e-4127-a792-c07d265b4d70_16x9.jpg", "https://media.wkyc.com/assets/WKYC/images/33d9e06f-6e57-4bc3-babf-9d4e1fdab68a/33d9e06f-6e57-4bc3-babf-9d4e1fdab68a_1920x1080.jpg", "https://www.wkyc.com/assets/shared-images/icons/close-menu.svg", "https://media.wkyc.com/assets/KPNX/images/c98095e4-30df-4d70-8956-2e3e97de46f5/c98095e4-30df-4d70-8956-2e3e97de46f5_360x203.jpg", "https://media.wkyc.com/assets/WKYC/images/f885bdc9-0d62-42c4-ad58-bdeff08fbed3/f885bdc9-0d62-42c4-ad58-bdeff08fbed3_360x203.jpg", "https://media.wkyc.com/assets/WKYC/images/f885bdc9-0d62-42c4-ad58-bdeff08fbed3/f885bdc9-0d62-42c4-ad58-bdeff08fbed3_16x9.jpg", "https://media.wkyc.com/assets/WKYC/images/ad507b9c-626e-4127-a792-c07d265b4d70/ad507b9c-626e-4127-a792-c07d265b4d70_360x203.jpg", "https://www.wkyc.com/assets/shared-images/logos/wkyc.png"], "top_img": "http://content.tegna-media.com/photo/2017/12/15/et_hhh_kyle_richards_on_kim_121417_11949137_ver1.0.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": [], "canonical_link": "https://www.wkyc.com/article/entertainment/entertainment-tonight/kyle-richards-explains-why-kim-richards-wont-be-on-real-housewives-of-beverly-hills-season-8/95-499684208", "title": "Kyle Richards Explains Why Kim Richards Won\u2019t Be on 'Real Housewives of Beverly Hills\u2019 Season 8", "meta_data": {"theme-color": "#d81f32", "category": "entertainment", "og": {"url": "https://www.wkyc.com/article/entertainment/entertainment-tonight/kyle-richards-explains-why-kim-richards-wont-be-on-real-housewives-of-beverly-hills-season-8/95-499684208", "title": "Kyle Richards Explains Why Kim Richards Won\u2019t Be on 'Real Housewives of Beverly Hills\u2019 Season 8", "description": "Fans may\u00a0have seen the last of Kim Richards on", "type": "article", "image": {"identifier": "http://content.tegna-media.com/photo/2017/12/15/et_hhh_kyle_richards_on_kim_121417_11949137_ver1.0.jpg", "width": 1140, "height": 641}, "article": {"published_time": "12/15/2017 11:17:40 AM"}, "site_name": "wkyc.com", "locale": "en_US"}, "article": {"opinion": "false", "content_tier": "free", "section": "wkyc,entertainment,entertainment-tonight"}, "twitter": {"title": "Kyle Richards Explains Why Kim Richards Won\u2019t Be on 'Real Housewives of Beverly Hills\u2019 Season 8", "image": "http://content.tegna-media.com/photo/2017/12/15/et_hhh_kyle_richards_on_kim_121417_11949137_ver1.0.jpg", "card": "summary_large_image", "site": "wkyc", "description": "Fans may\u00a0have seen the last of Kim Richards on", "domain": "www.wkyc.com/"}, "viewport": "width=1170", "site": "wkyc.com", "description": "Fans may\u00a0have seen the last of Kim Richards on", "fb": {"app_id": 145836432870387}, "robots": "max-image-preview:large"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1513307860.0, "source": "https://www.wkyc.com", "summary": ""}

Black Friday 2023 falls on November 24. The actual date shifts, but the day of the week stays the same: it's always the Friday after Thanksgiving.\n\n\n\nWhile Black Friday deals will officially kick off on November 24, sales will launch much earlier than that thanks to the recent Amazon Prime Day sale, which was held on October 10 and 11. The retailer's October Prime Day sale acts as a kick-off to the Black Friday shopping season, with retailers launching competing sales, which include early Black Friday deals.\n\n\n\nYou can expect Amazon, Best Buy, Walmart, and Target to continue to release sales throughout October and November, and I'll be covering all the best early Black Friday deals in this guide.\n\n\n\nThe good news is that, based on years past, retailers don't hold their best Black Friday deals for Black Friday proper; you can find record-low prices in the lead-up on best-selling tech, kitchen appliances, home items, and more.\n\nWhat Black Friday deals do we expect to see in 2023? We can predict what Black Friday deals we'll see at the 2023 sale by looking back at last year's best-sellers and recent holiday sales. Last year's bestselling categories, according to Amazon, included Home, Fashion, Toys, Beauty, and Amazon's own devices. This matched up with Amazon's top-selling items, like the Echo Dot, Fire TV Stick, and Apple AirPods. Other popular offers were the Nintendo Switch, LG's C2 OLED TV, Fullstar's viral vegetable chopper, and the Revlon one-step volumizer hair dryer.\n\n\n\nWe expect to see the same mix of items on sale during the 2023 Black Friday deals event, such as Amazon devices, like the Echo Pop smart speaker, the 2023 LG C3 OLED TV, as well as Apple's latest devices, including the Apple Watch 9, the MacBook Air M2 and the iPhone 15.\n\nBlack Friday 2023: our buying advice\n\n(Image credit: Getty)\n\nWhere to find the best Black Friday deals? Most online retailers offer Black Friday deals, but it's our job to sort through the thousands of offers to find the very best bargains from the bunch. You'll typically find the best Black Friday deals from big-name retailers like Walmart, Best Buy, and Target, with Amazon leading the pack.\n\n\n\nAmazon is a Black Friday favorite, not only because they offer record-low prices but also because they offer discounts on a wide variety of categories. So whether you're looking for tech items like laptops, TVs, or AirPods or searching for discounts on clothing, kitchen appliances, or toys - Amazon is likely to offer Black Friday deals on the product you're after.\n\n\n\nWalmart is another Black Friday favorite, thanks to a handful of early sales that the retailer typically launches in the run-up to Black Friday proper. The retailer also offers special prices and early access to its Black Friday sales for Walmart Plus members, which is something to consider if you're interested in the subscription.\n\n\n\nOther retailers that offer impressive Black Friday deals include Best Buy, Target, Dell, Home Depot, Lowe's, and Overstock. It can be overwhelming with so many retailers and promotions, but that's where our deal expertise comes in. We go through every retailer to pick out the very best Black Friday deals so you can make sure you're getting the lowest price available.\n\nHow to get the best Black Friday deals in 2023?\n\nHomework really helps. Some retailers up prices from August through to October so they can offer supposedly amazing discounts on Black Friday, so don\u2019t be fooled by such moves.\n\nThey\u2019re particularly prevalent in expensive consumer electronics such as TVs or laptops with product numbers rather than names, with products that were dropped down to a great bargain price suddenly being pushed back to their MSRP again.\n\nIt\u2019s also a very good idea to be flexible: for example, if you're interested in a Samsung 4K TV it\u2019s best to think about the features you want rather than a specific model number: the BRV553ABD34-82C-9218-X may not be discounted on Black Friday 2023, but an almost identical set with the specification you want probably will be.\n\nSo do your research on what matters, and we\u2019ll do our best to give you the right comparison needed.\n\nHowever, don\u2019t be fooled into thinking that something that looks like a five-star set is the same but cheaper - certain elements (often with regards to screen quality or image processing) won\u2019t be as high quality to achieve that lower price point.\n\nWhen to shop for the best Black Friday deals?\n\nEarly holiday shopping was a smart move at last year's Black Friday sale, as we saw the best deals launch in the weeks leading up to the day itself. Retailers like Amazon, Best Buy, and Walmart launched sales as early as October with impressive offers for best-selling tech, appliances, toys, and more.\n\n\n\nWe were extremely impressed with last year's early Black Friday deals, in fact, we were disappointed with offers on Black Friday proper. Most retailers offered their best deals in the weeks leading up to Black Friday, with record-low prices on AirPods, OLED TVs, air fryers, and laptops, to name a few. When Black Friday proper arrived, many of these items were either out of stock or, while still discounted, at a higher price.\n\n\n\nOur advice? If you see an early Black Friday deal and it's down to record-low price, we recommend purchasing the item rather than waiting for Black Friday itself. In fact, retailers like Best Buy had a FAQs page that stated that its early Black Friday deals were available in limited quantities and you wouldn't find better prices during the Black Friday sales period. By taking advantage of early Black Friday deals, you're not only avoiding the madness of Black Friday, but you're securing an item that might sell out come November 24.\n\nBlack Friday vs. Amazon Prime Day\n\nAmazon actually held two Prime Day sales this year, the July Prime Day sale and the recent October event named Amazon Prime Big Deals Day. The October sale is a preview for the 2023 Black Friday deals event and acts as a kick-off to the early holiday shopping season.\n\n\n\nSo what can we learn about Amazon's July and October Prime Day events, and how does it stack up to Black Friday? Amazon reports that the first day of Prime Day was the single largest sales day in the company's history, with over 375 million items purchased worldwide. The most popular categories were home, fashion, and beauty, and the top-selling deals included the Fire TV Stick, Apple AirPods, and the Bissell Little Green carpet cleaner.\n\n\n\nWe expect similar trends at this year's Black Friday sale, as consumers are hungry for deals. The most significant difference between Black Friday and Prime Day is the length of the sales and Amazon's dominance and membership requirements when it comes to Prime Day. Amazon's Prime Day sale is a 48-hour-only sale, with a Prime membership required to shop the sale. The two-day sale is also known for its deep discounts on Amazon's own devices, which is why it's no surprise that the Fire TV stick was a top-selling item.\n\n\n\nWhile Black Friday is technically only one day, November 24, retailers launch Black Friday deals this month, which stretch the holiday sale into weeks of savings. Black Friday isn't exclusive to Amazon, and some of the best deals come from other retailers like Best Buy and Walmart.\n\nWhy is it called Black Friday?\n\nLet\u2019s take a history lesson to find how why they call it Black Friday: the first known mention of Black Friday related to this shopping experience was in November 1951, when the journal Factory Management and Maintenance used it to describe people calling in sick the day after Thanksgiving so they could have an extra day off work.\n\nAt the same time, US police were using the phrases \u201cBlack Friday\u201d and \u201cBlack Saturday\u201d to describe the horrendous traffic that occurred at the beginning of the pre-Christmas shopping season.\n\nIn 1961, the local government moved to change the shopping season to \u201cBig Friday\u201d and \u201cBig Saturday,\u201d but it never caught on. The notion that it was the time when retailers moved 'back into the black' was seen far later and clearly an attempt to bring positivity to the term.", "images": ["https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/9HccSFpG9bJk6YfG32ysFE-200-100.jpg", "https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/TaH2ttGpm2acvZ5r3xrRMn-320-80.jpg", "https://vanilla.futurecdn.net/techradar/media/img/missing-image.svg", "https://vanilla.futurecdn.net/techradar/media/shared/img/flags/nosize/US.svg", "https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/8jSuihajgWWjU8XvejPTZV-200-100.jpg", "https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/BqSVSsoyudwAzxcETVzRXR-200-100.jpg", "https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/r5jupfYKrr4ZpCZ4dxJLaR-200-100.jpg", "https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/aQUhNcCHWNJDywSSqD547J-200-100.jpg", "https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/7vscNmtwDHPEVuNLKFHnjR-200-100.jpg", "https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/hjLMiHM26peGHMNorm4EqB-200-100.jpg", "https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/9N8hcTRVSh6tfRcNBGDVKi-200-100.jpg", "https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/4YHuSSdmVKR6uUZczwTZ6E.jpeg", "https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/LuJxmeFhKpHdmgYSTWZsGc-200-100.jpg", "https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/p3WSP3e8FHKUkWtsAsJTvU-1200-80.jpg", "https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/KoZpmmMpoTPcUfSVMZbTvA-200-100.jpg", "https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/eipvd6nnHNjvDu3qVJdzmM-200-100.jpg", "https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/hoiaXvSbvjW5QYs2VUpXZg-200-100.jpg", "https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/p2sHq4UxKHustquhhSRtNf-200-100.jpg", "https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/f5ZvGSmjpsFRcYE9CyLgek-200-100.jpg", "https://vanilla.futurecdn.net/cyclingnews/media/img/missing-image.svg", "https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/MFZiYVgtXBfwTamFgi3goP-200-100.jpg"], "top_img": "https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/p3WSP3e8FHKUkWtsAsJTvU-1200-80.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Mackenzie Frazier", "Social Links Navigation"], "canonical_link": "https://www.techradar.com/black-friday/black-friday-deals-sales", "title": "Black Friday deals 2023: early sales from Walmart, Amazon and Best Buy", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width,minimum-scale=1,initial-scale=1", "pub_date": "2022-10-31T15:38:59+00:00", "description": "Looking for the best Black Friday deals?

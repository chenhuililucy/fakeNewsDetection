The void of her absence is felt by many, especially now as yesterday would have been Rivera\u2019s 48th birthday.\n\nTo commemorate the special occasion, Rivera\u2019s family celebrated at the grand opening of the Jenni Rivera Boutique in Huntington Park, California on Sunday, July 2. The store is focused on \u201cexecuting Jenni\u2019s dream by providing fun, sporty, high-quality clothing and accessories for the voluptuous, bold, beautiful woman.\u201d\n\nhttps://www.instagram.com/p/BWDIzXcgSOF/?taken-by=chiquisoficial&hl=en\n\nFans turned out to show their love and support for the late diva de la banda.\n\nhttps://www.instagram.com/p/BWDjq6WjCHY/?tagged=jenniriveraboutique\n\nIt was an emotional scene as family members cut the ribbon at the new store. Fortunately a mariachi band was there to help keep spirits high.\n\nhttps://www.instagram.com/p/BWEUrB_Dnl7/?tagged=jenniriveraboutique\n\nLater that day Rivera\u2019s eldest daughter Chiquis posted a sweet birthday message to \u2018the most important woman in my life.\u2019\n\nhttps://www.instagram.com/p/BWD9mPOARMg/?taken-by=chiquisoficial&hl=en\n\nChiquis has been open about the struggles she shared with her mother in the past. Prior to her mother\u2019s passing, the two women weren\u2019t on speaking terms due to a nasty rumor that tore them apart. Despite the fact that they were never able to mend their relationship in person, Chiquis still feels an incredible closeness to her mom. \u201cEvery day I feel like she\u2019s with me\u2026 she\u2019s always in my heart.\u201d", "images": ["https://hiplatina.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2023/10/Katya-Echazarreta-Barbie-Auction-1.jpg?resize=132,74&quality=80", "https://hiplatina.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2023/10/jennifer-vasquez-goth-blogger.jpg?resize=480,270&quality=80", "https://hiplatina.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2022/03/eva-longoria.jpg?resize=480,270&quality=80", "https://hiplatina.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2023/10/delia-giandeini-7FtM9dZ9ck8-unsplash.jpg?resize=480,270&quality=80", "https://hiplatina.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2023/10/hillary-heron.jpeg?resize=480,270&quality=80", "https://hiplatina.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2023/10/selena-gomez-food-network-holiday.png?resize=132,74&quality=80", "https://hiplatina.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2023/10/indigenous-heroes-latin-america.jpg?resize=480,270&quality=80", "https://hiplatina.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2023/10/latina-equal-pay2023.jpg?resize=480,270&quality=80", "https://hiplatina.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2023/08/Sargento_Receta-Ariana.jpg?resize=150,150&quality=80", "https://hiplatina.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2021/10/ancestors.jpg?resize=150,150&quality=80", "https://hiplatina.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2022/10/latin-urban-legends.jpg?resize=150,150&quality=80", "https://hiplatina.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2023/10/hillary-heron.jpeg?resize=132,74&quality=80", "https://hiplatina.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2017/07/453px-Jenni_Rivera_performing_in_2009_1-e1610730424970.png?w=1200", "https://hiplatina.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2017/07/453px-Jenni_Rivera_performing_in_2009_1-e1610730424970.png?resize=360,270&quality=80", "https://hiplatina.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2023/10/Katya-Echazarreta-Barbie-Auction-1.jpg?resize=480,270&quality=80", "https://hiplatina.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2023/10/selena-gomez-food-network-holiday.png?resize=480,270&quality=80", "https://hiplatina.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2022/03/eva-longoria.jpg?resize=132,74&quality=80", "https://hiplatina.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2023/09/activists.jpg?resize=150,150&quality=80"], "top_img": "https://hiplatina.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2017/07/453px-Jenni_Rivera_performing_in_2009_1-e1610730424970.png?w=1200", "keywords": [], "authors": [], "canonical_link": "https://hiplatina.com/jenni-rivera-birthday-boutique-opening/", "title": "Jenni Rivera\u2019s Family Celebrated Her Birthday at a Boutique Opening Inspired By the Late Singer", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width,minimum-scale=1", "description": "It\u2019s hard to believe that it\u2019s been almost five years since the talented Jenni Rivera was tragically killed in a plane crash in Mexico.\u00a0The void of", "robots": "max-image-preview:standard", "theme-color": "#FFFFFF", "og": {"locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "site_name": "HipLatina", "title": "Jenni Rivera's Family Celebrated Her Birthday at a Boutique Opening Inspired By the Late Singer - HipLatina", "description": "It\u2019s hard to believe that it\u2019s been almost five years since the talented Jenni Rivera was tragically killed in a plane crash in Mexico.\u00a0The void of", "url": "https://hiplatina.com/jenni-rivera-birthday-boutique-opening/", "image": {"identifier": "https://hiplatina.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2017/07/453px-Jenni_Rivera_performing_in_2009_1-e1610730424970.png?w=1200", "width": 453, "height": 431, "alt": "Photo: Wikimedia Commons/Julio Enriquez"}}, "article": {"published_time": "2017-07-03T03:01:39-07:00", "modified_time": "2023-09-27T04:57:47-07:00", "author": {"username": "jessica-molina"}, "section": "News and Entertainment", "tag": "Jenni Rivera"}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "site": "@hip_latina", "title": "Jenni Rivera's Family Celebrated Her Birthday at a Boutique Opening Inspired By the Late Singer - HipLatina", "description": "It\u2019s hard to believe that it\u2019s been almost five years since the talented Jenni Rivera was tragically killed in a plane crash in Mexico.\u00a0The void of", "url": "https://hiplatina.com/jenni-rivera-birthday-boutique-opening/", "image": {"identifier": "https://hiplatina.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2017/07/453px-Jenni_Rivera_performing_in_2009_1-e1610730424970.png?w=4096", "alt": "Photo: Wikimedia Commons/Julio Enriquez"}}}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1499076099.0, "source": "https://hiplatina.com", "summary": ""}

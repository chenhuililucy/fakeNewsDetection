Strange said in a prepared statement. \u201cToday\u2019s lengthy sentence is a fitting punishment for his egregious crimes.\u201d\n\nU.S. District Judge G. Murray Snow also ordered Menaged to pay victims more than $33.5 million in restitution.\n\nThe investigation was conducted by the Department of Homeland Security, Homeland Security Investigations and Internal Revenue Service-Criminal Investigation.\n\nREAD MORE:\n\nBuyers beware: Tips from state securities regulator on how to avoid financial scams\n\nPolice: Scottsdale man fakes cancer, takes $30,000 from family, friends\n\nHow to avoid gifting cybercriminals your financial info this season", "images": ["https://www.azcentral.com/gcdn/-mm-/bdc8bed1130aa1172deceb4368a86f2149b2ff60/c=2-0-929-524/local/-/media/2017/10/20/Phoenix/Phoenix/636441169922868674-menaged.jpg?width=927&height=524&fit=crop&format=pjpg&auto=webp", "https://www.azcentral.com/gcdn/-mm-/bdc8bed1130aa1172deceb4368a86f2149b2ff60/c=2-0-929-524/local/-/media/2017/10/20/Phoenix/Phoenix/636441169922868674-menaged.jpg?width=660&height=374&fit=crop&format=pjpg&auto=webp", "https://www.azcentral.com/gcdn/presto/2022/04/18/USAT/5e65e405-399e-4a65-8d35-f90f601a30ce-BrieAnna_Frank_Headshot_1.jpg?crop=490,490,x0,y0&width=48&height=48&format=pjpg&auto=webp"], "top_img": "https://www.azcentral.com/gcdn/-mm-/bdc8bed1130aa1172deceb4368a86f2149b2ff60/c=2-0-929-524/local/-/media/2017/10/20/Phoenix/Phoenix/636441169922868674-menaged.jpg?width=927&height=524&fit=crop&format=pjpg&auto=webp", "keywords": [], "authors": [], "canonical_link": "https://www.azcentral.com/story/news/local/phoenix/2017/12/19/reality-tv-star-investor-scott-menaged-fraud-sentence-17-years-prison/966504001/", "title": "Investor, former 'Property Wars' star sentenced to 17 years for fraud", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1,minimum-scale=1", "theme-color": "#0098FE", "og": {"title": "Investor, former 'Property Wars' star sentenced to 17 years for fraud", "description": "Scott Menaged targeted more than 200 victims in various fraud schemes that resulted in more than $30 million in losses.", "url": "https://www.azcentral.com/story/news/local/phoenix/2017/12/19/reality-tv-star-investor-scott-menaged-fraud-sentence-17-years-prison/966504001/", "site_name": "The Arizona Republic", "image": {"identifier": "https://www.azcentral.com/gcdn/-mm-/bdc8bed1130aa1172deceb4368a86f2149b2ff60/c=2-0-929-524/local/-/media/2017/10/20/Phoenix/Phoenix/636441169922868674-menaged.jpg?width=927&height=524&fit=crop&format=pjpg&auto=webp", "width": 927, "height": 524}, "type": "article"}, "article": {"author": "BrieAnna J.

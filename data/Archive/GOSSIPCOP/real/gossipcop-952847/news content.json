The lucky guests will get to experience the festivities from within the grounds of Windsor Castle (where Prince Harry and Meghan Markle said \"I do\").\n\nThose selected will be able to watch the royals and guests arrive, listen to a live broadcast of the ceremony, and see the couple make their first appearance as newlyweds when they exit the chapel. They'll also be able to see the pair embark on a carriage ride through Windsor, according to Buckingham Palace.\n\nApplicants must be over five years old (children under 16 must be accompanied by an adult) and living at a U.K. or British Forces address (sorry American fans!). APPLY\n\n\n\nGetty Images\n\nIn addition to the selected members of the public, representatives of charities supported by the couple, members of the Windsor community, children from local schools, Windsor Castle residents, and members of Royal Household staff will also be present on castle grounds.\n\nPrince Harry and Meghan Markle also invited members of the public to their May 19 wedding at the same venue. Their guests included 2,640 people, which consisted of 1,200 individuals from across the U.K., 200 people from charities they're associated with, 100 students from local schools, 610 Windsor residents and members of the St George's Chapel, and 530 members of the Royal Households and Crown Estate.\n\nHarry and Meghan take a carriage ride through Windsor after their wedding ceremony. Getty Images\n\nPrincess Eugenie is a cousin to Princes William and Harry, daughter of Prince Andrew, Duke of York, granddaughter the Queen, and the ninth in line for the throne. She and longtime boyfriend-turned-fianc\u00e9 Brooksbank announced their engagement at the end of January earlier this year.", "images": ["https://www.harpersbazaar.com/_assets/design-tokens/fre/static/icons/social/youtube.ce3e1ae.svg?primary=%2523ffffff&id=social-button-icon", "https://www.harpersbazaar.com/_assets/design-tokens/harpersbazaar/static/images/logos/logo.a645fa4.svg?primary=%2523ffffff", "https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/hbz-royal-wedding-carriage-ride-960178930-1531922009.jpg?crop=1xw:1xh;center,top&resize=980:*", "https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/gettyimages-1715462683-6526d52e013b4.jpg?crop=0.737xw:1.00xh;0.133xw,0&resize=360:*", "https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/meghan-duchess-of-sussex-and-prince-harry-duke-of-sussex-news-photo-1696970611.jpg?crop=0.668xw:1.00xh;0,0&resize=360:*", "https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/gettyimages-1718649344-651ebd01ca0a1.jpg?crop=1.00xw:0.812xh;0,0.0156xh&resize=360:*", "https://www.harpersbazaar.com/_assets/design-tokens/fre/static/icons/social/pinterest.e8cf655.svg?primary=%2523ffffff", "https://www.harpersbazaar.com/_assets/design-tokens/harpersbazaar/static/images/logos/network-logo.6416a85.svg?primary=%2523ffffff", "https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/gettyimages-1727573518-652591ca813cd.jpg?crop=0.939xw:0.625xh;0.0497xw,0.0395xh&resize=360:*", "https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/gettyimages-1716375030-65257a095ab6d.jpg?crop=0.604xw:0.906xh;0.255xw,0&resize=360:*", "https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/hbz-jack-brooksbank-princess-eugenie-index-new482347928-1531923321.jpg?crop=1.00xw:1.00xh;0,0&resize=1200:*", "https://www.harpersbazaar.com/_assets/design-tokens/fre/static/icons/social/pinterest.e8cf655.svg?primary=%2523ffffff&id=social-button-icon", "https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/gettyimages-1716694442-651d6eb1e2e9d.jpg?crop=0.670xw:1.00xh;0.250xw,0&resize=360:*", "https://hips.hearstapps.com/vidthumb/images/hbz-rw-eugenie-1530034631.jpg?crop=1.00xw:1.00xh;0,0&resize=1200:*", "https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/gettyimages-1731520592-6527fa9f9aa89.jpg?crop=1.00xw:0.515xh;0,0.0272xh&resize=360:*", "https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/gettyimages-1737697352-652c4c85b1a66.jpg?crop=0.668xw:1.00xh;0.181xw,0&resize=360:*", "https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/dsc8091-652583a1f11c7.jpg?crop=0.434xw:0.651xh;0.391xw,0.173xh&resize=360:*", "https://www.harpersbazaar.com/_assets/design-tokens/fre/static/icons/social/twitter.c44156b.svg?primary=%2523ffffff&id=social-button-icon", "https://hips.hearstapps.com/rover/profile_photos/67055711-c808-4a4d-811a-e7155a2bce10_1667409691.file?fill=1:1&resize=160:*", "https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/gettyimages-1729566146-65269cbbc3172.jpg?crop=1.00xw:0.649xh;0,0.0280xh&resize=360:*", "https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/hbz-princess-eugenie-jack-embed-1525191246.jpg?crop=1xw:1xh;center,top&resize=980:*", "https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/gettyimages-1728281421-6525aed41eee1.jpg?crop=1.00xw:0.668xh;0,0.0962xh&resize=360:*", "https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/gettyimages-1716643662-651d619ea028b.jpg?crop=1.00xw:0.715xh;0,0.0468xh&resize=360:*", "https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/hbz-jack-brooksbank-princess-eugenie-482347928-1531922174.jpg?resize=640:*", "https://www.harpersbazaar.com/_assets/design-tokens/fre/static/icons/social/instagram.f282b14.svg?primary=%2523ffffff&id=social-button-icon", "https://www.harpersbazaar.com/_assets/design-tokens/fre/static/icons/social/facebook.a5a3a69.svg?primary=%2523ffffff&id=social-button-icon"], "top_img": "https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/hbz-jack-brooksbank-princess-eugenie-index-new482347928-1531923321.jpg?crop=1.00xw:1.00xh;0,0&resize=1200:*", "keywords": [], "authors": [], "canonical_link": "https://www.harpersbazaar.com/celebrity/latest/a22326816/princess-eugenie-jack-brooksbank-wedding-public/", "title": "Princess Eugenie and Jack Brooksbank Are Inviting Members of the Public To Their Wedding", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "X-UA-Compatible": "IE=edge,chrom=1", "msapplication-tap-highlight": "no", "title": "Princess Eugenie and Jack Brooksbank Invite Members of the Public To Their Wedding", "description": "Royal bride-to-be Princess Eugenie and her fianc\u00e9 Jack Brooksbank are inviting 1,200 members of the public to attend their wedding on October 12.

Last week, when news reports suggested that the family-friendly Disney had its eye on Fox, Reynolds joked about what a Disney-fied Deadpool might look like.\n\nDisney purchased multiple assets from 21st Century Fox for $52.4 billion in stock, acquiring all of its film and TV productions, as well as its back catalog of films and shows. The deal also means that the rights to Marvel characters like the X-Men and Deadpool will revert back to Disney\u2019s Marvel Studios, after being owned by Fox for years.\n\nA sequel to 2016\u2019s Deadpool is already in the works, with David Leitch (Atomic Blonde) directing the Merc with a Mouth\u2019s latest outing. Josh Brolin is on board to play Cable, with Zazie Beetz also joining as Domino.\n\nDeadpool 2 will hit theaters June 1, 2018.", "images": ["https://ew.com/thmb/wd14x5CbwXXnFCPDqsYwpd_yP2A=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/df-09376_rgb-2000-583a61b80d8142bb9be0759fb316b401.jpg", "https://ew.com/thmb/6MQC3ByHsDSe_YqNK41rjr7DpNE=/75x75/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/coggan-235b9f8569ae4b5b8e53e3dbaae7b966.jpeg"], "top_img": "https://ew.com/thmb/wd14x5CbwXXnFCPDqsYwpd_yP2A=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/df-09376_rgb-2000-583a61b80d8142bb9be0759fb316b401.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Ew'S Editorial Guidelines"], "canonical_link": "https://ew.com/movies/2017/12/14/ryan-reynolds-disney-fox-merger-deadpool-photo/", "title": "Ryan Reynolds pokes fun at Disney-Fox merger with Deadpool photo", "meta_data": {"robots": "max-image-preview:large, NOODP, NOYDIR", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "description": "Ryan Reynolds pokes fun at Disney-Fox merger with Deadpool photo", "parsely-section": "Movies", "parsely-tags": "Celebrity,People,Movies,Ryan Reynolds,Deadpool", "article": {"section": "EW", "author": "https://www.facebook.com/entertainmentweekly"}, "fb": {"app_id": 2485718348341688}, "og": {"type": "article", "site_name": "EW.com", "url": "https://ew.com/movies/2017/12/14/ryan-reynolds-disney-fox-merger-deadpool-photo/", "title": "Ryan Reynolds pokes fun at Disney-Fox merger with Deadpool photo", "description": "Ryan Reynolds pokes fun at Disney-Fox merger with Deadpool photo", "image": "https://ew.com/thmb/wd14x5CbwXXnFCPDqsYwpd_yP2A=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/df-09376_rgb-2000-583a61b80d8142bb9be0759fb316b401.jpg"}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "site": "@EW", "title": "Ryan Reynolds pokes fun at Disney-Fox merger with Deadpool photo", "description": "Ryan Reynolds pokes fun at Disney-Fox merger with Deadpool photo", "image": "https://ew.com/thmb/wd14x5CbwXXnFCPDqsYwpd_yP2A=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/df-09376_rgb-2000-583a61b80d8142bb9be0759fb316b401.jpg"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#F4F4F4", "msapplication-TileImage": "/static/1.5.1/icons/favicons/mstile-144x144.png", "msapplication-square70x70logo": "/static/1.5.1/icons/favicons/mstile-70x70.png", "msapplication-square150x150logo": "/static/1.5.1/icons/favicons/mstile-150x150.png", "msapplication-square310x310logo": "/static/1.5.1/icons/favicons/mstile-310x310.png", "msapplication-wide310x150logo": "/static/1.5.1/icons/favicons/mstile-310x150.png"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1513180800.0, "source": "https://ew.com", "summary": ""}

All of them, which is not fair.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nEarlier in the segment, the 53-year-old host also spoke about #MuteRKelly, a campaign started by two women to remove R. Kelly from the music industry.\n\n\u201cWhat is this, 10 years too late?\u201d Williams said. \u201cIt\u2019s not going to work. Black people aren\u2019t really good at protesting. Not since the King march.\u201d\n\nThe comment provoked this reaction from an audience member:\n\n\"The Wendy Williams Show\"\n\nWilliams then addressed R. Kelly\u2019s marriage to the late musician Aaliyah when she was 15.\n\n\u201cThe #MeToo movement hasn\u2019t affected R. Kelly,\u201d she said. \u201cR. Kelly wasn\u2019t a \u2018me too.\u2019 Aaliyah voluntarily married him when she was 15 years old. Her parents voluntarily let her do it.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWilliams also mentioned the R&B singer\u2019s infamous sex tape, saying that the young girl featured in the video \u201clet it go down.\u201d (Kelly\u2019s lawyer called the tape a forgery.)\n\nPeople on Twitter were especially upset about this comment.\n\nThese are GIRLS! They are children. Why does that have to be explained to you! This man URINATED ON AN 8th GRADER and you have the nerve to say it\u2019s HER FAULT!?! @WendyWilliams Have you ever talked to one of his victims?! #muteRKelly @metoo \u2014 Tarana (@TaranaBurke) January 26, 2018\n\nWendy Williams defense of R Kelly on her morning show is the same argument used by Roy Moore supporters. Disgusting; blaming 15 year old children for being attacked by a sexual predator. #WendyWilliams \u2014 M.E. Carter (@MeritaC) January 25, 2018\n\nIn July, Kelly was also the subject of a BuzzFeed investigation that reported the singer was holding multiple women in an abusive sex cult against their will. Kelly denied the accusations.\n\n#MuteRKelly, the campaign that sparked Williams\u2019 tirade on her show, has said that it is responsible for the cancellations of R. Kelly concerts in eight cities.", "images": ["https://pixel.quantserve.com/pixel/p-3aud4J6uA4Z6Y.gif", "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5c1161451f0000c407267e90.jpg?ops=100_100", "https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6723616&c3=&c4=&c5=&c6=&c15=&cj=1", "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5a6fa0b6160000450013924a.png?cache=al83GOTMNq&ops=1200_630", "https://www.facebook.com/tr?id=1621685564716533&ev=PageView&noscript=1", "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5a6f9deb1d000026006ad294.gif?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale"], "top_img": "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5a6fa0b6160000450013924a.png?cache=al83GOTMNq&ops=1200_630", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Senior Reporter"], "canonical_link": "https://www.huffpost.com/entry/wendy-williams-sick-me-too-movement_n_5a6f8638e4b0ddb658c9961d", "title": "Wendy Williams Says She\u2019s \u2018Sick Of This #MeToo Movement\u2019", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, minimum-scale=1.0", "description": "The talk show host also says \"black people aren\u2019t really good at protesting.

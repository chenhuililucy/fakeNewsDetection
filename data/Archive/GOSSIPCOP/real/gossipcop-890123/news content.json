Kourtney, 38, also went all out, wearing her hair in tight curls and donning black gloves and a white blazer to emulate the late Jackson.\n\nMichael Jackson & Madonna pic.twitter.com/RTxA90XfBC \u2014 Kim Kardashian West (@KimKardashian) October 29, 2017\n\nThe Madonna ensemble was Kim\u2019s third Halloween look this year. Earlier in the day, the Keeping Up with the Kardashians star gave fans a peek at her costume as Aaliyah.\n\nShe sported elaborate eye makeup and straight locks to play the late singer, completing her costume with a jeweled choker and coordinating top that flaunted her stomach. The look matched the ensemble Aaliyah wore in her \u201cTry Again\u201d music video.\n\nBaby Girl Aaliyah pic.twitter.com/5GUHkNJgNi \u2014 Kim Kardashian West (@KimKardashian) October 29, 2017\n\nOn Saturday, the mom of two revealed on Twitter that the inspiration for all her costumes this year came from her favorite musical figures.\n\n\u201cMy Halloween theme this year is ICONS!

Cher, dressing up for Casamigos\u2019 annual Halloween bash on Friday night in a custom-made Alexandrine outfit that replicated the 71-year-old music icon\u2019s exact look from the 1973 Academy Awards.\n\n\u201cCher definitely has a better body,\u201d Kim said on Periscope. \u201cHer stomach\u2026 I don\u2019t think anyone could compare.\u201d\n\nRELATED VIDEO: A Brief History of Heidi

That\u2019s when three dancers left Ms. Swift\u2019s \u201cRed\u201d tour after about six months. They were hired by Ms. Perry, who was preparing her \u201cPrismatic\u201d tour.\n\nOne of the dancers, Lockhart Brownlie, gave an interview to an Australian newspaper in December 2013, in which he explained that all three had previously toured with Ms. Perry in 2011. He said that Ms. Swift\u2019s tour \u201cwas a great experience and she\u2019s a great person to work with, but then Katy contacted us.\u201d\n\nNow we\u2019ve got bad blood\n\nSpeculation about a feud grew after a September 2014 article about Ms. Swift in Rolling Stone, pegged to the release of her album \u201c1989.\u201d\n\nMs. Swift explained the subject of her song \u201cBad Blood,\u201d which would become the album\u2019s fourth single. She said a former friend \u201cdid something so horrible\u201d to her:\n\nI was like, \u2018Oh, we\u2019re just straight-up enemies.\u2019 And it wasn\u2019t even about a guy! It had to do with business. She basically tried to sabotage an entire arena tour. She tried to hire a bunch of people out from under me.\n\nShe later told Rolling Stone that her desire in writing the song \u201cwas not to create some gossip-fest.\u201d", "images": ["https://web.archive.org/web/20180510010402im_/https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/05/10/us/10XP-KATYTAYLOR/10XP-KATYTAYLOR-articleLarge.jpg?quality=75&auto=webp&disable=upscale", "https://web.archive.org/web/20180510010402im_/https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/05/10/us/10XP-KATYTAYLOR/10XP-KATYTAYLOR-facebookJumbo.jpg"], "top_img": "https://web.archive.org/web/20180510010402im_/https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/05/10/us/10XP-KATYTAYLOR/10XP-KATYTAYLOR-facebookJumbo.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Michael Gold"], "canonical_link": "https://web.archive.org/web/20180510010402/https://www.nytimes.com/2018/05/09/arts/music/katy-perry-taylor-swift.html", "title": "Taylor Swift and Katy Perry Ended Bad Blood With an Olive Branch.

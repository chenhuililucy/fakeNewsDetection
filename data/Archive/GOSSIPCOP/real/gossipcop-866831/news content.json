But like, it should be for $9.4 million, right? Wowza.\n\nThe Agency has the listing for the sprawling property, which contains 4 bedrooms, 6 bathrooms, and 5,564 square feet on over an acre of land. It's set behind gates, so it's extra private and exclusive, and has the chef's kitchen of our dreams, with state-of-the-art appliances, marble countertops, and is open to the backyard, where you'll find a zero-edge pool, grill, and gazebo.\n\nThe home also has an insanely cool \"upper club level,\" with a bar, media room, and huge sky terrace. It's minutes from the Sunset Strip and set right above the Chateau Marmont, so the location is seriously choice.\n\nMore From House Beautiful\n\nOur favorite part, though, is hands-down the panoramic city views from the living rooms floor-to-ceiling windows and the sky terrace. You can see all the way from downtown Los Angeles to the Pacific Ocean, and it's giving us all the La La Land feels.\n\nSee the full listing at The Agency.\n\nFollow House Beautiful on Instagram.", "images": ["https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/design-school-all-together-1599147724.jpg?crop=1xw:1xh;center,top&resize=480:*", "https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/ghhfranklindesk-1950-jpg-651dadc69304b.jpg?crop=0.784xw:1.00xh;0.216xw,0&resize=360:*", "https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/50-dingletown-rd-06-print-6508c69b60ba2.jpg?crop=0.750xw:1.00xh;0.126xw,0&resize=360:*", "https://www.housebeautiful.com/_assets/design-tokens/fre/static/icons/social/instagram.f282b14.svg?primary=%2523ffffff&id=social-button-icon", "https://www.housebeautiful.com/_assets/design-tokens/fre/static/icons/social/twitter.c44156b.svg?primary=currentColor&id=link-out-embed", "https://www.housebeautiful.com/_assets/design-tokens/fre/static/icons/social/facebook.a5a3a69.svg?primary=%2523ffffff&id=social-button-icon", "https://www.housebeautiful.com/_assets/design-tokens/fre/static/icons/social/pinterest.e8cf655.svg?primary=%2523ffffff", "https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/1-2660-peachtree-36d-final-1-650c8aa121932.jpg?crop=0.752xw:1.00xh;0.125xw,0&resize=360:*", "https://www.housebeautiful.com/_assets/design-tokens/fre/static/icons/social/pinterest.e8cf655.svg?primary=%2523ffffff&id=social-button-icon", "https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/an-aerial-view-of-the-house-where-actress-marilyn-monroe-news-photo-1694123370.jpg?crop=0.671xw:1.00xh;0.165xw,0&resize=360:*", "https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/private-residence-studio-city-by-mrbarcelo-002-6500bccc624d6.jpg?crop=0.670xw:1.00xh;0.0801xw,0&resize=360:*", "https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/1-jpg-64cc081f7476b.jpg?crop=0.668xw:1.00xh;0.167xw,0&resize=360:*", "https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/origin-6500f00cf33bf.jpg?crop=0.619xw:0.926xh;0.162xw,0&resize=360:*", "https://www.housebeautiful.com/_assets/design-tokens/housebeautiful/static/images/logos/network-logo.894fc98.svg?primary=%2523ffffff", "https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/hb-edit-news-template-social-image-11-64dd63b1ced86.png?crop=0.503xw:1.00xh;0.497xw,0&resize=360:*", "https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/1-1318-34th-street-nw-6525a0734572b.jpg?crop=0.668xw:1.00xh;0.167xw,0&resize=360:*", "https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/bad-bunny-nyc-apartment-652d45fe18170.jpg?crop=0.497xw:0.994xh;0.503xw,0.00641xh&resize=360:*", "https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/demi-lovato-v01-1536187377.png?resize=640:*", "https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/il-1588xn-4319696424-gtmu-651ad677d46e0.jpg?crop=0.668xw:1.00xh;0.332xw,0&resize=360:*", "https://www.housebeautiful.com/_assets/design-tokens/fre/static/icons/social/twitter.c44156b.svg?primary=%2523ffffff&id=social-button-icon", "https://hips.hearstapps.com/rover/profile_photos/ef8bfb40-9112-4aad-88cd-a101f5e3fcfa_1683140210.file?fill=1:1&resize=160:*", "https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/demi-lovato-v01-1536187377.png?crop=1xw:1xh;center,top&resize=1200:*", "https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/1156-sanysidrodrive-07-2048px-64b83a82b4a83.jpg?crop=0.667xw:1.00xh;0.207xw,0&resize=360:*", "https://www.housebeautiful.com/_assets/design-tokens/housebeautiful/static/images/logos/logo.d4c2c6d.svg?primary=%2523ffffff", "https://www.housebeautiful.com/_assets/design-tokens/fre/static/icons/social/youtube.ce3e1ae.svg?primary=%2523ffffff&id=social-button-icon"], "top_img": "https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/demi-lovato-v01-1536187377.png?crop=1xw:1xh;center,top&resize=1200:*", "keywords": [], "authors": [], "canonical_link": "https://www.housebeautiful.com/design-inspiration/real-estate/a22996176/demi-lovato-house-for-sale/", "title": "We're Freaking Out Over The Inside Of Demi Lovato's House", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "X-UA-Compatible": "IE=edge,chrom=1", "msapplication-tap-highlight": "no", "title": "Demi Lovato's House is For Sale for $9.5 Million - See Inside Demi Lovato's Home", "description": "Demi Lovato's house just hit the market, and the inside is so gorgeous.

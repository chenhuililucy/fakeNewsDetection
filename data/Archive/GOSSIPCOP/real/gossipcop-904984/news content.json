Singing it is, however, encouraged from school onwards.\n\nTens of thousands of college football fans attended the match between the University of Georgia and the University of Alabama.", "images": ["https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/400xn/p0glrw8l.jpg", "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/400xn/p0glvgqq.jpg", "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/400xn/p0gm2l4k.jpg", "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/400xn/p05sws9c.jpg", "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/400xn/p0glxr8c.jpg", "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/400xn/p0gm2mxs.jpg", "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/400xn/p05stxnr.jpg", "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/400xn/p0glyqfg.jpg", "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/400xn/p0glt09b.jpg", "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/C5E5/production/_99516605_mediaitem99516604.jpg", "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/400xn/p0glkqby.jpg", "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/400xn/p050cky4.jpg", "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/400xn/p05t02k3.jpg", "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/400xn/p0glx5c4.jpg", "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/400xn/p0glmjp0.jpg", "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/400xn/p05t7pvb.jpg"], "top_img": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/C5E5/production/_99516605_mediaitem99516604.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": [], "canonical_link": "https://www.bbc.com/news/av/world-us-canada-42616112", "title": "Did President Trump forget the words to the national anthem?", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "description": "Tens of thousands of college football fans were watching as The Star-Spangled Banner started.", "theme-color": "#FFFFFF", "og": {"type": "website", "locale": "en_GB", "site_name": "BBC News", "url": "https://www.bbc.com/news/av/world-us-canada-42616112", "title": "Did Trump forget the words to US anthem?", "description": "Tens of thousands of college football fans were watching as The Star-Spangled Banner started.", "image": {"identifier": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/C5E5/production/_99516605_mediaitem99516604.jpg", "alt": "Trump singing the US national anthem"}}, "fb": {"admins": 100004154058350, "app_id": 1609039196070050}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@BBCWorld", "site": "@BBCWorld", "url": "https://www.bbc.com/news/av/world-us-canada-42616112", "title": "Did Trump forget the words to US anthem?", "description": "Tens of thousands of college football fans were watching as The Star-Spangled Banner started.", "image": {"identifier": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/C5E5/production/_99516605_mediaitem99516604.jpg", "alt": "Trump singing the US national anthem"}}, "msapplication-TileImage": "https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/core/website/assets/static/icons/windows-phone/news/windows-phone-icon-270x270.23502b4459eb7a6ab2ab.png"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": null, "source": "https://www.bbc.com", "summary": ""}

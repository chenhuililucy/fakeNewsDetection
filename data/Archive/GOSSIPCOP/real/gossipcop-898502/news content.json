The two are going through a divorce, but have maintained a positive, friendly relationship despite the split. And that was clear when they reminisced about the good times in Los Angeles.\n\nRelated Story How to Get a Reading With the Long Island Medium\n\nBefore they met, Larry opened up about his new life in California, and said moving away helped him distance himself from the stress of his life. He was filmed working out in the gym, where a new focus on his health has led to a whole new physique. \u201cI\u2019ve worked on myself, and I\u2019ve realized that this is a new chapter in my life and to embrace it and to make the best of it,\u201d he said.\n\nHe told his friend Kejo what he wanted out of meeting Theresa. \u201cI know there are some things that I want to say and need to tell her,\u201d he said. \u201cShe\u2019s been a part of my life for so long that I just want to know how she\u2019s doing, and I\u2019m sure she\u2019d like to know how I\u2019m doing. And I want to tell her how I\u2019m doing.\u201d\n\nMore From Good Housekeeping\n\nThe two sat down at a restaurant in Santa Monica, California to talk about the year they had lived on separate coasts. They discussed their children, their parents, and how they both look back on their decades together fondly despite how things ended.\n\nLarry wanted to clear the air about why he moved to California, but Theresa said she understood. \u201cIt seems like a long time, and what can I tell you? It\u2019s been an adjustment,\u201d Larry said. \u201cAnd I miss everybody. I don\u2019t want you to think that I just up and left and ran away.\u201d\n\nThis content is imported from poll.

Because they were,\u201d Larry said. \u201cI helped you grow, and you helped me grow, and you helped me be the person I am today.

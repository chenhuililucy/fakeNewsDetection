Some people know that they like grilled cheese and they\u2019ll eat it every day for the rest of their lives. I want to try everything. If I have grilled cheese once I\u2019m like, \u2018That was cool, what\u2019s next?\u2019\u201d\n\nRegardless of what term she\u2019s using \u2015 or not using \u2015 to define her sexuality, Stewart hasn\u2019t allowed what others think about her love life to keep her from living in her own authentic way.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve been deeply in love with everyone I\u2019ve dated,\u201d Stewart told Harper\u2019s Bazaar. \u201cDid you think I was faking it? I\u2019ve always really embraced a duality. And really, truly, believed in it and never felt confused or struggling...\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe actress also opened up about dressing as \u201ca total tomboy\u201d when she was younger and discovering it was \u201cnot the most normal thing.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt actually really hurt my feelings, like badly,\u201d she mused. \u201cLike, I remember being in the sixth grade [aged 11] and [people would say] \u2018Kristen looks like a man. You\u2019re a boy,\u2019 or whatever, and I was so offended, horrified and embarrassed. Now I look back on it and I\u2019m like, \u2018Girl, be proud of that!\u2019\u201d", "images": ["https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6723616&c3=&c4=&c5=&c6=&c15=&cj=1", "https://pixel.quantserve.com/pixel/p-3aud4J6uA4Z6Y.gif", "https://www.facebook.com/tr?id=1621685564716533&ev=PageView&noscript=1", "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/59833b5a15000021008b4e5b.jpeg?cache=7gQeVRT7ug&ops=crop_0_263_2667_1931%2Cscalefit_720_noupscale", "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/644805be260000610086a460.png?ops=100_100", "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/561eb8441400002b003c844c.jpeg?ops=scalefit_960_noupscale", "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/59833b5a15000021008b4e5b.jpeg?cache=7gQeVRT7ug&ops=1200_630"], "top_img": "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/59833b5a15000021008b4e5b.jpeg?cache=7gQeVRT7ug&ops=1200_630", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Editorial Director", "Huffpost Personal"], "canonical_link": "https://www.huffpost.com/entry/kristen-stewart-dating-men_n_5983304be4b0fa1575fc4a7c", "title": "Kristen Stewart Opens Up About Dating Men Again In The Future", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, minimum-scale=1.0", "description": "\"I want to try everything.\"", "keywords": "Gay Life,celebrity relationships,bisexuality,Kristen Stewart,Queer Voices,Entertainment,Style,Women", "fb": {"app_id": 46744042133}, "og": {"title": "Kristen Stewart Opens Up About Dating Men Again In The Future", "type": "article", "image": {"identifier": "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/59833b5a15000021008b4e5b.jpeg?cache=7gQeVRT7ug&ops=1200_630", "url": "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/59833b5a15000021008b4e5b.jpeg?cache=7gQeVRT7ug&ops=1200_630", "type": "image/jpeg", "width": 1200, "height": 630}, "url": "https://www.huffpost.com/entry/kristen-stewart-dating-men_n_5983304be4b0fa1575fc4a7c", "site_name": "HuffPost", "locale": "en_US", "description": "\"I want to try everything.\""}, "article": {"tag": "Gay Life,celebrity relationships,bisexuality,Kristen Stewart,Queer Voices,Entertainment,Style,Women", "section": "Queer Voices", "published_time": "2017-08-03T16:10:53Z", "modified_time": "2017-08-03T16:10:53Z"}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "site": "@huffpostqueer", "title": "Kristen Stewart Opens Up About Dating Men Again In The Future", "image": {"identifier": "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/59833b5a15000021008b4e5b.jpeg?cache=7gQeVRT7ug&ops=1200_630", "width": 1200, "height": 630}, "description": "\"I want to try everything.\""}, "al": {"ios": {"url": "huffpostnews:///?editionID=us&entryID=us_5983304be4b0fa1575fc4a7c", "app_store_id": 306621789, "app_name": "HuffPost"}}, "robots": "max-snippet:-1,max-image-preview:large,max-video-preview:-1", "google-site-verification": "97Mj-wW7u8U1NOnkW1rfH-I1kgO0-a9YsgoesOk41R8"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1501776653.0, "source": "https://www.huffingtonpost.com", "summary": ""}

The State Attorney\u2019s Office tells The Blast that because cops grabbed Repp before he came in contact with Beckinsale, his actions did not proceed far enough to be considered stalking.\n\nIn the police report, cops described Repp as having \u201can irrational obsession with\u201d Beckinsale and say he has \u201ctraveled across the country in an effort to harass her.\u201d\n\nAccording to police, Repp had an incident with Beckinsale in Salt Lake City back in 2016 where he allegedly made physical contact with Beckinsale where he touched her in the back. Police say Repp \u201cmade a statement to the victim in reference to stabbing her.\u201d\n\nRepp was also was detained in Houston in 2016 after he was found at another event Beckinsale was attending.", "images": ["https://d3stcg8iy7fvse.cloudfront.net/2023/10/17062531/Erin-Andrews-Taylor-Swift-Travis-Kelce.jpg?aspect_ratio=390:219&width=390", "https://d3stcg8iy7fvse.cloudfront.net/2023/08/19193905/MEGA1001360_046-1-e1692499177507.jpg?aspect_ratio=2:1&width=180", "https://d3stcg8iy7fvse.cloudfront.net/2021/05/social_share.png", "https://d3stcg8iy7fvse.cloudfront.net/2022/01/Rhianna-Pregnant-Nicki-Minaj-Congratulates-Pictures-scaled-e1643653235281.jpg?aspect_ratio=390:219&width=390", "https://d3stcg8iy7fvse.cloudfront.net/2023/03/mega467646_005-1-scaled-e1678819085775.jpg?aspect_ratio=390:219&width=390", "https://d3stcg8iy7fvse.cloudfront.net/2021/06/theblast-logo.png", "https://d3stcg8iy7fvse.cloudfront.net/2023/10/17112113/Conor-McGregor-MMA-Return-scaled-e1697566890840.jpg?aspect_ratio=390:219&width=390", "https://d3stcg8iy7fvse.cloudfront.net/2023/09/15101603/MEGA603992_020-e1694798255840.jpg?aspect_ratio=390:219&width=390", "https://d3stcg8iy7fvse.cloudfront.net/2023/10/17115334/Aaron-Rodgers-1-scaled-e1697568831299.jpg?aspect_ratio=390:219&width=390", "https://d3stcg8iy7fvse.cloudfront.net/2022/04/MEGA851477_003-scaled.jpg?aspect_ratio=390:219&width=390", "https://d3stcg8iy7fvse.cloudfront.net/2023/07/MEGA959895_001-scaled-e1690377898104.jpg?aspect_ratio=2:1&width=180", "https://d3stcg8iy7fvse.cloudfront.net/previous/3c33143007769c732778bff3fa701cfd.jpg?aspect_ratio=13:6&width=1300", "https://d3stcg8iy7fvse.cloudfront.net/2023/10/16172146/Pnk-Cancels-Shows-scaled-e1697502148923.jpg?aspect_ratio=390:219&width=390", "https://d3stcg8iy7fvse.cloudfront.net/2023/09/29021257/MEGA959896_079-scaled-e1695978925128.jpg?aspect_ratio=2:1&width=180", "https://d3stcg8iy7fvse.cloudfront.net/2023/06/Kate-Beckinsale-scaled-e1686690550452.jpeg?aspect_ratio=2:1&width=180", "https://d3stcg8iy7fvse.cloudfront.net/2022/11/Maren-Morris-and-Ryan-Hurd-scaled-e1668351543261.jpg?aspect_ratio=390:219&width=390", "https://d3stcg8iy7fvse.cloudfront.net/2023/01/mega53002_003-scaled-e1672944824883.jpg?aspect_ratio=390:219&width=390"], "top_img": "https://d3stcg8iy7fvse.cloudfront.net/2021/05/social_share.png", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Theblast Staff"], "canonical_link": "https://theblast.com/58195/kate-beckinsale-alleged-stalker/", "title": "Kate Beckinsale\u2019s Alleged Stalker Has All Charges Dropped", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "robots": "index, follow, max-image-preview:large, max-snippet:-1, max-video-preview:-1", "og": {"locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "Kate Beckinsale's Alleged Stalker Has All Charges Dropped", "description": "The man arrested for allegedly stalking Kate Beckinsale won\u2019t do any time behind bars and had all charges against him dropped.

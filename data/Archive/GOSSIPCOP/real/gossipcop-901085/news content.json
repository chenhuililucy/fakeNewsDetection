Catch up on the Bravo App.\n\nLast year, we were obsessed with finding out what drove the usually stoic Erika Girardi to tearfully say, \"You don't know what I deal with every night.\" Now this year, it's a diva-licious moment from Lisa Vanderpump that drops Kyle Richards and Dorit Kemsley's jaws in the Season 8 trailer (clip above) \u2014 and it had us picking up our jaws off the floor, too.\n\nAt the end of the trailer, we see Lisa drive away in her car after saying to Kyle and Dorit, \"I'm going home to my husband who would rather spend time with me tonight than you would.\" That's followed by Kyle and Dorit looking visibly shook.\n\nRelated\n\n\n\n\n\nLisa revealed what was going through her mind during that moment in a recent interview with ET. \u201cNormally I have my cool, and I kind of lost it that day,\u201d she said. \u201cI think on Beverly Hills, you see this wonderful, glittering existence, and you also see the struggle that the women go through.\u201d\n\nKyle compared her behavior to a certain iconic TV character who's also known for her fierceness. \u201cI was like, \u2018OK, Alexis Carrington, got it,\u2019\u201d she told ET, comparing Lisa to the beloved Dynasty diva. \u201cIt was so out of character for her to let her guard down like that, that's why my mouth was literally hanging open.\u201d\n\n\n\nWe have a feeling that jaw-dropping moments won't be in short supply this season of RHOBH. Check out a sneak peek of Tuesday's all-new episode at 9/8c, below.", "images":

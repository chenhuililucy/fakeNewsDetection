That's when I found a sketch GOG did on Jimmy Kimmel called Guillermo in Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2 which I thought was just a joke for hyping up the movie. But I actually went back to the movie and skipped through it for a couple of minutes, that's when I found a single frame that you can actually see Guillermo in. I know this is pretty stupid but I thought it was pretty funny he was actually in the movie.", "images": ["https://www.redditstatic.com/shreddit/assets/favicon/64x64.png"], "top_img": "https://www.redditstatic.com/shreddit/assets/favicon/64x64.png", "keywords": [], "authors": [], "canonical_link": "", "title": "Dive into anything", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, viewport-fit=cover", "apple-mobile-web-app-capable": "yes", "apple-mobile-web-app-status-bar-style": "black", "msapplication-navbutton-color": "#000000", "theme-color": "#000000"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": null, "source": "https://www.reddit.com", "summary": ""}

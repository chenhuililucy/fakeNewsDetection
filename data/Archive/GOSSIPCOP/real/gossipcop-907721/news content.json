Cast member DJ Pauly D is the guest DJ and the event starts at 8 p.m.\n\nAttempts to reach Jenk\u2019s for comment were unsuccessful.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not a fan of \u2018Jersey Shore\u2019 but I did hear they were here at the boardwalk at Jenk\u2019s during the day (on Sunday),\u201d said Point Pleasant Beach Mayor Stephen Reid.\n\nFilming at Jenk\u2019s would not require a permit from the borough, Reid said.\n\n\u201cAs long as it\u2019s on private property, that\u2019s fine,\u201d Reid said. \u201cI don\u2019t get it but I know they have lot loyal viewers all these years later. They\u2019re more mellow because they\u2019re married and have children.\u201d\n\n\u201cJersey Shore,\u201d originally based in Seaside Heights and produced by 495 Productions, ran on MTV from 2009 to 2012. Most of the cast filmed the 2017 \u201cReunion Road Trip: Return to the Jersey Shore,\u201d which aired on E!, at Jenkinson\u2019s Pavilion Restaurant.\n\nOn Sunday, cast members cavorted with members of the band Daddy Pop, who were performing at Jenk\u2019s while they were there in the late afternoon.\n\n\u201cSnooki fell over the drums,\u201d said Guy Buonocore Jr. of Neptune, who was there for Daddy Pop. \u201cHer and the other girls went up on stage and were dancing.\u201d\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think she was drunk but she fell because she had high heels on.\u201d\n\nNicole \u201cSnooki\u201d Polizzi, Pauly DelVecchio, Jenni \u201cJWoww\u201d Farley, Mike \u201cThe Situation\u201d Sorrentino, Vinny Guadagnino, Angelina Pivarnick and unidentified companions were spotted entering the pool area in the back of the Headliner upon exiting two minivan taxis with New York license plates at 3:45 p.m. on Monday.\n\nMore:MTV 'Jersey Shore' returns to Seaside Heights: Who was on the boardwalk?\n\nFilming took place Monday afternoon and Monday night when the cast returned. Jenni, Mike, Pauly D and Vinny played beer pong, without the beer but with garbage cans and volleyballs instead of ping-pong balls and cups.\n\nRonnie had a couch talk time with Snooki and Angelina while the rest of the guys played ball. Drinks and food were enjoyed, and the shoot lasted until 2 a.m. Tuesday morning.\n\n\u201cI think it\u2019s nice exposure for the Jersey Shore,\u201d said Matt Haymond of Hamilton, who was at the Headliner while filming was taking place on Monday. \u201cThey come in, do their thing and enjoy the place.\u201d\n\nThe \u201cShore house\u201d is a bit inland \u2014 at 18 Kinney Road in Manalapan. Crew members were seen from the street at 18 Kinney on Saturday, Aug. 4 while about a dozen vans and cars, many with New York license plates, were parked outside. Producers declined to comment for this story.\n\nMichael is a former resident of Manalapan.\n\nSo far, Season 2 of \u201cJersey Shore Family Vacation\u201d was filmed in Seaside Heights in a two-day shoot, Las Vegas and Atlantic City, according to Press and other reports. The cast was going to film at a home on Rochester Drive in Brick, but officials there denied a permit.\n\nIt\u2019s unclear if filming commenced in Wildwood, as was reported. What is clear is the officials there did not want them.\n\nDeena announces that she\u2019s pregnant and Mike gets married to Lauren Pesce during Season 2, according to trailers. Season 2 debuts Aug. 23.\n\nAttempts to reach MTV representatives for comment were unsuccessful.\n\nChris Jordan: cjordan@app.com.

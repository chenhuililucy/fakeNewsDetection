'Happy Birthday to my amazing wife,' he captioned the snap.\n\nIt appears the Deadpool actor couldn't get enough of his wife's joke, and commented on the picture: 'Awesome.'\n\nEarlier in the day, Reynolds revealed to his Twitter followers how he kicked off his birthday celebrations with his family.\n\nLively's joke comes day after she opened up on Good Morning America on the secret to her happy marriage with the actor.\n\n'In general, yeah, it's nice to have somebody who understands what you're doing. Especially because our job is so weird\u2014we have to, you know, like be married to other people, and it's all so strange. It's still strange. It's never normal, even when we're both doing it.'\n\nHappy birthday, Ryan!\n\nRelated Story Blake Lively\\'s Daughter May Feature On Swift Song", "images":

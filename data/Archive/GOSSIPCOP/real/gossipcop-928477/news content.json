And while a rosy few months followed for the star in which she began dating and quickly became engaged to Pete Davidson, things came crashing down in September, when her ex-boyfriend Mac Miller died of an accidental drug overdose.\n\nFollowing Miller's death, Grande and Davidson ended their engagement in October, with Grande canceling her appearance as the musical guest on the Sept. 29 season premiere of \"Saturday Night Live,\" for \"emotional reasons.\"\n\nMore:Ariana Grande trips during 'Ellen' performance, drops 'Breathin' video\n\nRelated:Ariana Grande says her exes heard 'Thank U, Next' before its release\n\nAfter suggesting that she would spend some time away from social media in the wake of Miller's death, Grande has been active on Twitter in recent days, tweeting plenty of jokes as well as sincere commentary.\n\n\"Thank god,\" she sardonically quoted one tweet that read \"Ariana Grande is like one song away from making girls never talk to guys ever again.\"\n\nAnd yet, when one fan tweeted \"Who is Ariana's therapist and are they accepting new clients,\" Grande replied with an earnest argument for seeking out mental health resources.\n\n\"This is funny as (expletive) but in all honesty therapy has saved my life so many times,\" she wrote. \"If you\u2019re afraid to ask for help, don\u2019t be. You don\u2019t have to be in constant pain & u can process trauma. I\u2019ve got a lot of work to do but it\u2019s a start to even be aware that it\u2019s possible.\"\n\nOn Wednesday, Grande had a busy day, dropping a video for her song \"Breathin\" and performing her new tune \"Thank U Next\" for the first time on \"Ellen.\" During the performance, Grande tripped on stage.\n\nShe also became visibly emotional at one point during the song.\n\nThe pop star celebrated her big day on social media by tweeting black-and-white clips from the performance and writing she was \"so ....... (expletive)...... grateful.\"", "images": ["https://www.usatoday.com/gcdn/presto/2018/11/07/USAT/5412209b-9225-4d6c-b989-7d4f47b05c34-AP_People_Ariana_Grande.JPG?width=660&height=447&fit=crop&format=pjpg&auto=webp", "https://www.usatoday.com/gcdn/presto/2018/11/07/USAT/5412209b-9225-4d6c-b989-7d4f47b05c34-AP_People_Ariana_Grande.JPG?crop=4014,2278,x0,y0&width=3200&height=1817&format=pjpg&auto=webp", "https://www.usatoday.com/gcdn/presto/2019/08/20/USAT/8d402890-014a-422b-8f53-7a1009028b6b-mcdermott_maeve.jpg?crop=2197,2197,x0,y64&width=48&height=48&format=pjpg&auto=webp"], "top_img": "https://www.usatoday.com/gcdn/presto/2018/11/07/USAT/5412209b-9225-4d6c-b989-7d4f47b05c34-AP_People_Ariana_Grande.JPG?crop=4014,2278,x0,y0&width=3200&height=1817&format=pjpg&auto=webp", "keywords": [], "authors": [], "canonical_link": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/life/entertainthis/2018/11/08/ariana-grande-jokes-her-woes-twitter-thank-u-next-no-tears-left-cry/1928731002/", "title": "Ariana Grande jokes about her recent struggles: 'The universe' was laughing", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1,minimum-scale=1", "theme-color": "#0098FE", "og": {"title": "Ariana Grande jokes about her recent struggles: 'The universe' was laughing", "description": "Ariana Grande originally released \"No Tears Left To Cry\" in April as a triumphant comeback single.

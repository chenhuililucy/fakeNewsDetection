Still, he has a few questions over Trump\u2019s apparent Twitter binges.\n\nIn a previous interview with The Hollywood Reporter, Baldwin had called his Emmy-winning Saturday Night Live impersonation of Trump to be \u201cagony\u201d \u2014 mainly because there\u2019s no end in sight to something he expected to only perform a few times. So Trump attacked on social media by tweeting, \u201cAlec, it was also agony for those who were forced to watch. You were terrible. Bring back Darrell Hammond, much funnier and a far greater talent!\u201d\n\n\u201cThe interesting thing is nobody\u2019s actually forced to watch,\u201d Baldwin said on The Tonight Show. \u201cI found that out. We don\u2019t force anyone to watch. Trump forces people to listen to him, I guess we call them government employees.\u201d\n\n\u201cDoes he have alerts or does he sequester himself for just a period of tweeting?\u201d Baldwin then asked Fallon. The actor imagined Trump sitting in front of the TV to watch Fox & Friends in the morning with a \u201ctriple order of bacon \u2014 he likes bacon, apparently he eats a lot of bacon \u2014 and he\u2019s got his phone and he\u2019s watching the news in his boxers and his bathrobe.\u201d\n\n\u201cOr,\u201d he added, \u201cdoes he get alerts? Is he in the middle of a session with North Korean diplomats and their talking about nuclear weapons? He\u2019s like, \u2018Hold on a moment, please. [Tweeting] Alec Baldwin, loser!'\u201d\n\nBaldwin most recently appeared on SNL as Trump for Charles Barkley\u2019s hosting stint. In an opening sketch, he declared that Wakanda, the fictional African nation from Marvel\u2019s Black Panther, is \u201cbeating\u201d the U.S. \u201cWakanda is laughing at us,\u201d Baldwin said, channeling Trump. \u201cThey\u2019ve got flying cars, people, in Wakanda.\u201d\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t need to tell you, it gets exhausting after a while,\u201d Baldwin told Fallon.\n\nAs he explained, \u201cHe came to me, [SNL executive producer] Lorne [Michaels], and said do the Trump thing, and we thought we were gonna do it for three shows in the fall. There was no way he was gonna win. And then he won and I remember lying in bed and going, \u2018Oh no.'\u201d\n\nWatch Baldwin on The Tonight Show in the clip above.", "images":

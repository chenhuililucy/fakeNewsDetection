She said she was flown to New York by Kelly after months of phone contact. It was in New York that Rodgers alleges Kelly \"initiated unwanted sexual contact\" in a hotel room and did not tell Rodgers he was infected with herpes. The suit claims she contracted the disease.\n\n\"He turns on all the lights ...And he's like, 'Take off your clothes.' And he says it, you know, with authority in his voice,\" Rodgers told CBS News Tuesday. \"Not just, you know, he's demanding me to do this. And I didn't take off my clothes because why would I? I just wasn't ready\u2026 Sex isn't something, you know, I'm ready for.\"\n\nRodgers said she ultimately submitted and had sex with Kelly even though she didn\u2019t want to. She claimed Kelly recorded the act on his iPad without her consent.\n\nRodgers said after the incident, Kelly asked how old she was.\n\n\u201cI told him and he\u2019s like, \u2018You know, if you\u2019re really, you know, 16, that you can tell daddy, right?\u2019 And he was like, \u2018You know, you just look about 14, 15 or 16,\u2019\u201d she said.\n\nRodgers said in the suit that she was in a relationship with Kelly for a year, in which he \u201croutinely engaged in intimidation, mental, verbal and sexual abuse, during and after sexual contact.\u201d The suit alleges Kelly\u2019s actions were \u201cdesigned to humiliate, embarrass, intimate and shame her.\u201d\n\nThe suit is seeking unspecified damages, alleging sexual battery, false imprisonment and failure to disclose a sexually transmitted disease. CBS News reported that Rodgers previously filed a criminal complaint with the Dallas Police Department in April.\n\nIn the past, Kelly has routinely denied allegations of sexual abuse. In response to the April criminal complaint, Kelly's representative said the musician \"categorically denies all claims and allegations.\"", "images": ["https://www.ajc.com/resizer/JNDOubz1mHfniKcUQTmSG2scEx8=/1200x630/d1fegwn2wjh0cs.cloudfront.net/06-26-2020/t_e0976b4518d94f90a8a71b5c1af8f799_name_F67079F0039F401EBFC2E8DB7A765B42", "https://www.ajc.com/entertainment/kelly-sued-texas-woman-for-sexual-battery-false-imprisonment-claims-gave-her-std/U0s7sixSNEVaMeXHxEwrEO/[object Object]", "https://www.ajc.com/pf/resources/images/ajc-hamburger-menu.png?d=1003", "https://www.ajc.com/pf/resources/images/amp-close.png?d=1003", "https://www.ajc.com/pf/resources/logos/AJC/sidebar-logo.png?d=1003"], "top_img": "https://www.ajc.com/resizer/JNDOubz1mHfniKcUQTmSG2scEx8=/1200x630/d1fegwn2wjh0cs.cloudfront.net/06-26-2020/t_e0976b4518d94f90a8a71b5c1af8f799_name_F67079F0039F401EBFC2E8DB7A765B42", "keywords": [], "authors": ["About The Author", "Kelcie Willis", "Cox Media Group National Content Desk"], "canonical_link": "https://www.ajc.com/entertainment/kelly-sued-texas-woman-for-sexual-battery-false-imprisonment-claims-gave-her-std/U0s7sixSNEVaMeXHxEwrEO/", "title": "R.

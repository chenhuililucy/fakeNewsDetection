In it, fans can see the making of Super Trouper; the big ensemble show-stopper that comes right at the end of the film. This featurette sees the male stars joking about their embarrassment, with Stellan Skarsgard - who plays the older Bill - saying: \u201cI can\u2019t sing, I can\u2019t dance and I don\u2019t know why they hired me for this. \u201cIt\u2019s probably just to humiliate me!\u201d\n\nColin Firth added: \u201cIt\u2019s quite liberating, really. \u201cThere\u2019s nothing more liberating than abandoning your dignity.\u201d Pierce Brosnan, famously maligned for his vocals in the 2008 original, quipped: \u201cYou\u2019ve got to be a brave man to sing in Mamma Mia, wear the spandex\u2026 dear heavens.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s so ridiculously out-there,\u201d Josh Dylan (Young Bill) said, \u201cthat you can\u2019t help but throw yourself in at 100%.\u201d\n\nMamma Mia 2's home ents release will provide many bonus features\n\nSuper Trouper is the big number that closes the show\n\nJeremy Irvine, playing the younger equivalent of Brosnan, said: \u201cI think it\u2019s kind of a competition between the young dads and the old dads to see who\u2019s worse at dancing.\u201d Mamma Mia 2 has been an indisputable success since its release in July. It has spent seven consecutive weeks in the Top 2 at the UK box office, and has grossed over \u00a361 million - now within touching distance of the \u00a368 million made by the first film. What\u2019s more, the soundtrack album continues to prove popular: it is now back at number one on the UK chart.\n\nSUBSCRIBE Invalid email We use your sign-up to provide content in ways you've consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

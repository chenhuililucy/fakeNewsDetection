According to TMZ, the couple has been fielding absurd offers to supply photos of the newborn months before the birth, but they have continually refused.\n\nVarious outlets were offering more than a million dollars, and even $2-5 million, for the photos. In the past, Kim and Kanye waited until North and Saint were two months old before posting their first photos online.\n\nTMZ also reports that Kim was in the hospital room during the delivery, and was the first person to have skin-to-skin contact with the baby. Kanye was in the delivery room as well, but remained behind a curtain as to give the surrogate some privacy during birth. He held the baby after she was born.", "images": ["https://img.buzzfeed.com/buzzfeed-static/static/2022-12/8/4/tmp/552c21d73b93/tmp-name-3-597-1670474596-115_dblbig.jpg",

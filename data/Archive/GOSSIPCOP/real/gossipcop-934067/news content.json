Night night babes,\u2019 she added.\n\nEarlier in the day the star, who welcomed daughter True with Thompson on 12 April, shared her plans for her first Mother\u2019s Day this Sunday on her app and website.\n\n\u2018I\u2019ve always loved Mother\u2019s Day and celebrating Kris Jenner, MJ and my sisters \u2014 but this year will be even more special because now I\u2019m a mommy, too!\u2019 Khlo\u00e9 wrote referring to her mother and grandmother Mary Jo.\n\n\u2018As of now, there aren\u2019t any special plans (that I know of, LOL). I\u2019m really enjoying spending quality time with True and loving just hibernating with her,\u2019 she concluded her post.\n\nOn the same day, Thompson spoke publicly about the couple\u2019s daughter for the first time during a Road Trippin podcast.\n\nThe 27-year-old told the hosts that True was \u2018doing good\u2019. \u2018Baby True is eating, sleeping and, uh, sh*tting,\u2019 he shared. \u2018That\u2019s all they do.\u2019\n\nWe can\u2019t wait to see a picture of the pair\u2019s little 'peanut'.", "images":

It's somewhere in your house.'\n\nHowever, while we all waited in baited breath for the 42-year-old to elaborate on fatherhood, the relatively-private star's conversation with the DeGeneres moved swiftly on to his remake of the musical romantic drama, A Star is Born, in which he stars and directs in opposite singer Lady Gaga.\n\nSpeaking of the 2017 Super Bowl singer, Cooper revealed she's 'really incredible'.\n\n'I thought I sang, I was like, 'Yeah, I sing'. It's so hard to sing! Like, people cook - but then there's cooking.\n\n'I'm a good cook, but to be an amazing chef. So, singing, I had no idea. I would get fatigued at the end of even a phrase...\n\nGetty Images\n\n'I've really been awakened to the phenomenon of singing. I just hope I can be believable enough so you can watch Stefani - that's her name, Gaga - just shine. Because she's incredible.\n\n'I just have to make sure at least you believe my character, so she can then be incredible,' he added.\n\nJust before the interview came to an end, DeGeneres couldn't resist mentioning the sensitive subject of fatherhood again, this time by teasing: 'I know you don't want to talk about the baby...\n\n'I just want to say, I knew you'd be a good father when I saw you in American Sniper,' she joked.\n\nEllen then showed the infamous clip of Cooper holding a fake baby in a dramatic scene from the Clint Eastwood biopic, at which he laughed: 'I can't believe you!\n\n'We already went through this before! It never gets old! It never gets old!' he joked.\n\nIt really doesn't, Bradley.\n\nRelated Story Bradley Cooper And Irina Shayk Welcome Baby Girl", "images":

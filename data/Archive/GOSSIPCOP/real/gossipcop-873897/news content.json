(Fey's video message comes in at about 3:53.)\n\n\"Let's go into the vault Kathie Lee, Kathryn Lee, because I have been on the show, and I've talked to you, and I must have been boring because you don't remember me, but I was there,\" Fey said. \"I think I've been on. I've been on. I'm willing to bet $100. I'm willing to bet $100 that I've been on the show, so let's role the clip.\"\n\nLooks like Gifford owes Fey. The show rolled a clip of Fey sitting down on \"Kathie Lee & Hoda\" back in December 2015 to promote the comedy, \"Sisters,\" starring herself and Amy Poehler.\n\nGifford joked that she must have confused Fey with \"Veep\" star Julia Louis-Dreyfus.\n\n\"I'm sorry, my bad, Tina Fey,\" Gifford said before extending an invite back to the show to make amends. \"I'm a senior citizen now. We tend to forget things, most things.\"\n\nCheck out Fey's 2015 interview below:", "images": ["https://media.phillyvoice.com/media/images/081816_Madej_Carroll.da37e452.fill-108x90-c0.jpg",

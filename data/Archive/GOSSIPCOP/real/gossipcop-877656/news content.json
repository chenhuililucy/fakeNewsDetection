Now, the actress has broken her silence on their epic romance.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re a couple. We\u2019re in love,\u201d she shared in the publication\u2019s October issue, on stands Sept. 12. \u201cI\u2019m sure there will be a time when we will have to come forward and present ourselves and have stories to tell, but I hope what people will understand is that this is our time. This is for us.\u201d\n\nShe added, \u201cIt\u2019s part of what makes it so special, that it\u2019s just ours. But we\u2019re happy. Personally, I love a great love story.\u201d\n\nAs previously reported, it was love at first sight for the duo who began dating in July of 2016 and have since been spotted globetrotting in Botswana, Jamaica, and London.\n\nSurprisingly, the pair has been quite successful at dodging the paparazzi, despite a growing obsession surrounding their relationship status.\n\n\u201cIt has its challenges, and it comes in waves\u2014some days it can feel more challenging than others,\u201d said Markle referencing all the attention. \u201cAnd right out of the gate it was surprising the way things changed. But I still have this support system all around me, and, of course, my boyfriend\u2019s support.\u201d\n\nFortunately, the \u201cSuits\u201d star has a few strong women by her side (new mom Serena Williams and \u201cSuits\u201d co-star Abigail Spencer) holding her hand through it all.\n\n\u201cHer personality just shines,\u201d Williams commented to the magazine. \u201cI told her, \u2018You\u2019ve got to be who you are, Meghan. You can\u2019t hide.'\u201d\n\n\u201cShe\u2019s got warm elegance, though her style is hard to pin down. It\u2019s classy and timeless. When you\u2019re talking to her, you feel like you\u2019re the only person on the planet. And it\u2019s just wonderful to see her so in love,\u201d added Spencer in the piece.\n\nWhile fans continue to speculate whether Harry will pop the question, Markle admits that the press, mainly tabloids, don\u2019t always get it right. \u201cI can tell you that at the end of the day I think it\u2019s really simple,\u201d she explained. \u201cWe\u2019re two people who are really happy and in love. We were very quietly dating for about six months before it became news, and I was working during that whole time, and the only thing that changed was people\u2019s perception. Nothing about me changed. I\u2019m still the same person that I am, and I\u2019ve never defined myself by my relationship.\u201d\n\nWhat are your thoughts on the actress finding love with a prince?

James Earl Jones, who was in the original 1994 film, will return to lend his voice as Simba\u2019s father, Mufasa, once more. A trio of comedians, John Oliver, Seth Rogan and Billy Eichner, will play Zazu, Pumbaa and Timon, respectively.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMany of the original songs are expected to return, according to reports, and the film will be a live-action remake similar to what Disney has done with \u201cThe Jungle Book,\u201d which was released last year and went on to become a box office smash grossing nearly $1 billion worldwide.\n\nThe film, directed by Jon Favreau, will be released in the summer of 2019.\n\nFans were notably overjoyed with the annoucement of the full cast, with many saying Glover\u2019s and Beyonc\u00e9\u2019s inclusion, and the casting of Chiwetel Ejiofor as the villainous Scar, would add some musical star power to an already talented roster.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe BLACKEST Disney movie ever premiers in 2019: Donald Glover, Beyonce and James Earl Jones star in The Lion King https://t.co/Q2WTg7RsO4 pic.twitter.com/AUBifIFLKn \u2014 The Root (@TheRoot) November 1, 2017\n\nIs the lion king movie real???

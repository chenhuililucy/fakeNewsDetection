That's as far as I know,' she posted on Twitter.\n\nNeed some suggestions, Khlo?\n\nHow about , Tequila, T-Rex, Krispy Kreme, Kiwi, Khlo\u00e9 Jr., or Khristan?\n\nNews of the baby girl's possible name comes days after the star announced the sex of her first child on Sunday's season finale of Keeping Up With the Kardashians.\n\nKhloe had previously told Ellen DeGeneres that she planned to name their son 'Tristan Jr.,' adding: 'For a girl, I don't even know where to begin. I think I want a K or a T.'\n\nOn Monday, the 33-year-old took to her app to explain her vision of how she hopes to bring up her first child.\n\nOn the app, she explained she wanted her baby to inherit the Kardashian family's 'loyalty and family unity', won't be afraid to 'make new friends' and form strong relationships with sisters Kim Kardashian and Kylie Jenner's newborns, Chicago West and Stormi Webster.\n\nLost track of all of the Kardashian/Jenner family's children? Here's our go-to guide to keeping up with family's offspring.\n\nWe're crossing our fingers for a baby Tequila or Kiwi.\n\nRelated Story Kylie Jenner Shows Off Stormi\\'s Cheeks", "images":

News.\n\nGetty Images\n\nThe pair will then watch the firing of the One O'clock Gun\u2014a tradition that dates back to 1861 before visiting Social Bite, a sandwich shop that donates its profits to social causes.\n\nIt's here where the duo will learn about the organisation's work, meet staff and get a tour of the kitchen, three years after George Clooney paid a visit to the homeless charity.\n\nTo sign off their visit in Scotland, Harry and Meghan will attend a reception at the Palace of Holyroodhouse where they will celebrate the achievements of the country's youth for Scotland's Year of Young People 2018.\n\nWhile Kensington Palace didn't reveal whether the newly-engaged couple will stay in Scotland for Valentine's Day, we have a feeling Harry might have something up his sleeve to impress his fianc\u00e9e given her love of V-Day.\n\nGetty Images\n\nIn her now-defunct lifestyle blog, The Tig, the 36-year-old explained how she prefers to spend the romantic holiday.\n\n'I think you need to be your own Valentine,' Markle wrote. 'I think you need to cook that beautiful dinner even when it's just you, wear your favourite outfit, buy yourself some flowers, and celebrate the self love that often gets muddled when we focus on what we don't have.'\n\nMeghan Markle // Instagram\n\nJust three years ago, the Californian beauty revealed she spent the loved-up day in New York with friends, 'imbibing some cocktail that's oddly pink, and jumping over icy mounds in my new shoes through the salted snowy streets of the West Village'.\n\nIf all else fails, Harry, consider flowers a must!\n\nRelated Story Alexander Skarsg\u00e5rd

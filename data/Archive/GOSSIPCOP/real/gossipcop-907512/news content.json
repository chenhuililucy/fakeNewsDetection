I played it past the finish line and then some and I loved it,\" the actress told Piers Morgan on his ITV series, Life Stories. \"Another actress should play it, maybe they could make it an African American Samantha Jones or a Hispanic Samantha Jones?'\n\nSo if Michael Patrick King and the Sex and the City team were to recast Samantha Jones, who would be the best replacement? Scroll through below to see some actors we think would fit in nicely with Carrie, Miranda and Charlotte.\n\nSia\n\nThe Australian pop songstress already threw her hat in the ring on Twitter. If Sia was cast would Samantha suddenly have an obsession with face-covering masks and wigs? One thing is for sure: Her Sex and the City song would be better than Fergie's.\n\nJane Krakowski\n\nDo we really need to sell you on this? Krakowski has basically played more outrageous versions of Samantha on 30 Rock and Unbreakable Kimmy Schmidt. Maybe she could even bring Tituss with her into the Sex and the City universe.\n\nVanessa Williams\n\nWilhelmina Slater, her character on Ugly Betty, was just as ballsy as Samantha, and now she's currently playing the lead on VH1's hit, Daytime Divas. Samantha Jones as a talk show host? Consider our DVRs set.\n\nKristy Swanson\n\nShe already followed in Cattrall footsteps in Mannequin 2, so why not keep the casting full circle?\n\nSofia Vergara\n\nCattrall would love a hispanic actress to play Samantha, and we think Vergara's perfect comedic timing would be perfect for the antics in Sex and the City.\n\nJean Smart\n\nWe love her, and she is not in enough things. Plus, you know they always get mistaken for each other anyway.\n\nHedda Lettuce\n\nOne of the most notable New York drag queens, Hedda would be a perfect choice because she has already played a Samantha Jones drag queen. In the second season episode, \"Old Dogs, New Dicks,\" Hedda's male alter ego, Steven Polito, plays Brad, an ex-boyfriend of Samantha, who she runs into at drag queen bingo. Brad's drag is a striking resemblance to his ex-girlfriend, and her drag name is even Samantha. \"Imitation is the sincerest form of flattery,\" Brad tells her in the scene.\n\nJoanna Lumley\n\nForget Samantha altogether and have Carrie and the girls travel to London for an epic Absolutely Fabulous/Sex and the City crossover.\n\nValerie Cherish", "images": ["https://images.paramount.tech/uri/mgid:arc:imageassetref:logotv.com:3cdef211-7973-46c0-8828-076bea8e6db5?quality=0.7&gen=ntrn&legacyStatusCode=true&format=webp&height=180&width=320&crop=true", "https://images.paramount.tech/uri/mgid:arc:imageassetref:logotv.com:3cdef211-7973-46c0-8828-076bea8e6db5?quality=0.7&gen=ntrn&legacyStatusCode=true&format=jpg&width=1200&height=630&crop=true"], "top_img": "https://images.paramount.tech/uri/mgid:arc:imageassetref:logotv.com:3cdef211-7973-46c0-8828-076bea8e6db5?quality=0.7&gen=ntrn&legacyStatusCode=true&format=jpg&width=1200&height=630&crop=true", "keywords": [], "authors": [], "canonical_link": "https://www.logotv.com/news/iloyb2/sex-and-the-city-kim-cattrall-replacement-samantha-jones", "title": "Who Could Replace Kim Cattrall In \"Sex And The City 3\"?", "meta_data": {"app_version": "d5e4a81f0-2833-2023-10-17", "robots": "noydir,noodp, max-image-preview:large", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=1, maximum-scale=2", "theme-color": "#87b6c0", "msapplication-config": "/browserconfig.xml", "description": "Someone call Jean Smart!", "original-source": "https://www.logotv.com/news/iloyb2/sex-and-the-city-kim-cattrall-replacement-samantha-jones", "search": {"title": "Who We Would Love To See Replace Kim Cattrall In", "description": "Someone call Jean Smart!", "imageUrl": "https://images.paramount.tech/uri/mgid:arc:imageassetref:logotv.com:3cdef211-7973-46c0-8828-076bea8e6db5?quality=0.7&gen=ntrn&legacyStatusCode=true", "imageHeight": 574, "imageWidth": 1020, "url": "/news/iloyb2/sex-and-the-city-kim-cattrall-replacement-samantha-jones", "contentType": "Article", "bucketName": "Article", "labelName": "News", "contentDate": "2017-10-10T18:01:46.000Z"}, "og": {"title": "Who Could Replace Kim Cattrall In \"Sex And The City 3\"?", "description": "Someone call Jean Smart!", "image": {"identifier": "https://images.paramount.tech/uri/mgid:arc:imageassetref:logotv.com:3cdef211-7973-46c0-8828-076bea8e6db5?quality=0.7&gen=ntrn&legacyStatusCode=true&format=jpg&width=1200&height=630&crop=true", "width": 1200, "height": 630}, "url": "https://www.logotv.com/news/iloyb2/sex-and-the-city-kim-cattrall-replacement-samantha-jones", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "description": "Someone call Jean Smart!", "title": "Who Could Replace Kim Cattrall In \"Sex And The City 3\"?", "image": "https://images.paramount.tech/uri/mgid:arc:imageassetref:logotv.com:3cdef211-7973-46c0-8828-076bea8e6db5?quality=0.7&gen=ntrn&legacyStatusCode=true&format=jpg&width=1200&height=630&crop=true"}}, "movies": [], "publish_date": null, "source": "http://www.newnownext.com", "summary": ""}

At one point of the nuptial ceremony, Middleton placed her hand on her husband's thigh, at which point the duke then rested his hand on top of hers \u2014 as seen in the post below by the fan account Kate Middleton Style.\n\nThe couple were all smiles in St. George's Chapel.

According to Meier, the founder of Beaumont Etiquette, it all comes down to each couple's \"personal preference.\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\"It's entirely up to each couple to do what they feel most comfortable,\" Meier said.\n\nHowever, since Queen Elizabeth II is rarely affectionate with Prince Philip in public, the monarch seems to have set \"an unwritten precedent\" that discourages PDA \u2014 especially during official royal engagements, as body language expert Robin Kermode previously told the Daily Mail.\n\n\"It is rare to see royal couples holding hands on official outings,\" Meier told People. \"A more serious engagement would warrant a more serious level of professionalism, which each royal is sure to follow.\"\n\nThat may be one reason why Prince William and Kate Middleton are rarely seen holding hands or engaging in PDA.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe duchess and duke often stand in this stoic pose.

As such, the duke may be held to stricter standards in his role as a royal.\n\nIn comparison, Prince Harry \u2014 who is sixth in line for the throne and therefore much less likely to become the British monarch in his lifetime \u2014 frequently holds hands with his wife, Meghan Markle, in public.\n\nRead more: Why Prince William and Kate Middleton never hold hands but Prince Harry and Meghan Markle do\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSince the two married in May, the Duke and Duchess of Sussex have made headlines time and time again for their sweet public displays of affection.\n\nMeghan Markle and Prince Harry held hands during an official visit to the Joff Youth Center on October 3. Chris Jackson/Getty Images\n\nOf course, it's just as likely that Prince William and Middleton simply prefer not to hold hands in public or to save such displays of affection for special occasions.\n\nVisit INSIDER's homepage for more.", "images": ["https://www.businessinsider.com.au/public/assets/INSIDER/US/logos/Insider-logo-dark-opt.svg", "https://www.businessinsider.com.au/public/assets/shared/light-switch.png", "https://www.businessinsider.com.au/public/assets/BI/US/icons/youtube.svg", "data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg' viewBox='0 0 1 1'%3E%3C/svg%3E", "https://www.businessinsider.com.au/public/assets/BI/US/icons/twitter.svg", "https://www.businessinsider.com.au/public/assets/shared/privacy-options.svg", "https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=9900186&cv=3.6.0&;cj=1&comscorekw=insider", "https://www.businessinsider.com.au/public/assets/BI/US/logos/Tech-Insider-opt.svg", "https://www.businessinsider.com.au/public/assets/BI/US/logos/BI-logo-dark-opt.svg", "https://www.businessinsider.com.au/public/assets/subscription/marketing/banner-overlay/top-left.svg", "data:image/svg+xml,%3C%3Fxml version='1.0' encoding='UTF-8'%3F%3E%3Csvg xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg' width='1' height='1'/%3E", "https://www.businessinsider.com.au/public/assets/subscription/marketing/banner-overlay/bottom-right.svg", "https://www.businessinsider.com.au/public/assets/BI/US/logos/newsletters/insider-today-logo.png", "https://www.businessinsider.com.au/public/assets/BI/US/icons/instagram.svg", "https://www.businessinsider.com.au/public/assets/badges/app-store-badge.svg", "https://www.businessinsider.com.au/public/assets/INSIDER/US/logos/insider-inc.svg", "https://www.businessinsider.com.au/public/assets/BI/US/icons/linkedin.svg", "https://i.insider.com/5ae7354019ee8619008b468a?width=1280&height=866&format=jpeg&auto=webp", "https://www.businessinsider.com.au/public/assets/badges/google-play-badge.svg", "https://www.businessinsider.com.au/public/assets/INSIDER/US/logos/insider-com-trademark-opt.svg", "https://www.businessinsider.com.au/public/assets/BI/DE/logos/BI-DE-Black-on-Light-final-footer-logo-opt.svg", "https://i.insider.com/5bc0c350bde70f7e96052f36?width=700", "https://www.businessinsider.com.au/public/assets/BI/US/icons/facebook.svg", "https://i.insider.com/5bc0c350bde70f7e96052f35?width=1200&format=jpeg", "https://www.businessinsider.com.au/public/assets/rebrand/newsletter-bull.png"], "top_img": "https://i.insider.com/5bc0c350bde70f7e96052f35?width=1200&format=jpeg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Lucy Yang"], "canonical_link": "https://www.insider.com/prince-william-kate-middleton-pda-princess-eugenie-wedding-2018-10", "title": "Prince William and Kate Middleton shared a rare moment of PDA at Princess Eugenie's wedding, and fans couldn't be happier", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "title": "Prince William and Kate Middleton shared a rare moment of PDA at Princess Eugenie's wedding, and fans couldn't be happier", "datePublished": "2018-10-12T15:42:00Z", "dateModified": "2018-10-15T15:42:38Z", "news_keywords": "Insider, Relationships", "description": "At Princess Eugenie and Jack Brooksbank's wedding,\u00a0Kate Middleton placed her hand on Prince William's thigh.

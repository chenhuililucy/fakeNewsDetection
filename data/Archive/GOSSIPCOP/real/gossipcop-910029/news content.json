WEEI\u2019s Alex Reimer recenty referred to Brady\u2019s 5-year-old daughter Vivian as an \u201cannoying little pissant.\u201d\n\nReimer reportedly made the comment Thursday night. Brady was asked about it Monday morning around 7:30 on the \u201cKirk and Callahan Show,\u201d where the hosts said it was \u201ca stupid thing to say.\u201d\n\nTom Brady with daughter Vivian. (Jamie Squire/Getty Images)\n\n\u201cWell, I think that \u2014 I\u2019ve tried to come on this show for many years and have showed you guys a lot of respect,\u201d Brady seethed. \u201cI\u2019ve always tried to come on and do a good job for you guys, so it\u2019s very disappointing when you hear that, certainly. But my daughter or any child, they certainly don\u2019t deserve that.\u201d\n\nTom Brady had stitches removed from throwing hand: report\n\nReimer\u2019s comment was a reference to Brady\u2019s daughter shouting to him in the opening scene of the Facebook documentary series, \u201cTom vs. Time.\u201d She was telling her dad she was going to play soccer.\n\nKirk Minihane apologized to Brady, but the QB, who is known to hold legendary grudges, cut the interview short.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll obviously evaluate whether I want to come on this show again, so I really don\u2019t have much to say this morning. So, maybe I\u2019ll speak with you guys some other time,\u201d Brady said before hanging up.\n\nAlex Reimer of WEEI (Alex Reimer via YouTube)\n\nAccording to WEEI, Reimer was informed Friday that he is suspended indefinitely. Minihane said on \"Kirk and Callahan\" that Reimer is \"very distraught.\"\n\nEagles fans don\u2019t hold back feelings with 'F--k Tom Brady' chant\n\nWEEI later released a statement calling Reimer's comments \"utterly indefensible\" and offering their \"sincerest apologies\" to Brady.\n\n\"We are disappointed and embarrassed by Alex Reimer\u2019s on-air comments made last Thursday evening,\" the statement reads. \"His remarks were utterly indefensible, and mean-spirited commentary directed in any way at children is wholly inappropriate.\"\n\nStatement from WEEI and Entercom: pic.twitter.com/Gz7zNGrStl \u2014 WEEI (@WEEI) January 30, 2018\n\nKevin Youkilis, the former Red Sox infielder who is married to Brady's sister Julie, shared his thoughts on Twitter Monday.\n\nAs a proud family man, it is taking everything in me to not take the low road today. We will continually take the high road while others feel it necessary to take a swipe at our family. #Karma #Family \u2014 Kevin Youkilis (@GreekGodOfHops) January 29, 2018\n\n\"As a proud family man, it is taking everything in me to not take the low road today,\" he wrote. \"We will continually take the high road while others feel it necessary to take a swipe at our family. #Karma #Family\"\n\nDespite Reimer's insensitive remarks, Brady later said he doesn't hope the radio host is fired.\n\n\u201cI just said I would certainly hope the guy\u2019s not fired,\u201d Brady said at Super Bowl Media Day, per Boston.com. \u201cI would hate for that to happen.\u201d\n\nThanks to the controversy, lookups for the word \"pissant\" are up 115,000 percent on Merriam-Webster.com, the dictionary site said. The word is typically used to describe someone or some thing as insignificant or worthless.\n\n\ud83d\udcc8Lookups for 'pissant' are up over 115,000%. It's not generally used to insult children. https://t.co/JONKAOhCxt \u2014 Merriam-Webster (@MerriamWebster) January 29, 2018\n\nIn the first episode of \"Tom vs. Time,\" an all-access documentary that follows Brady through this season, Brady summed up how the Patriots view the chaotic week heading into this week when he said, \"The Super Bowl environment is all about hype and ridiculous bulls---t that will go on,\" adding that \"being mentally tough is putting all that BS aside ... and doing what you have to do.\"\n\nWe'll see if Brady manages to do that this week.\n\nSign up for

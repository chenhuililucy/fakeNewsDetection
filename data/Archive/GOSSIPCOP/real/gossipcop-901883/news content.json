Princess Michael is very sorry and distressed that it has caused offense.\u201d\n\nMarkle, who is set to join the royal family when she marries Harry on May 19, 2018, is of mixed race. Her mother is African-American and her father is Caucasian.", "images": ["https://www.usatoday.com/gcdn/-mm-/4b4579eae006e8af8dc4e54bf4514a796cea1f87/c=1756-429-3674-1513/local/-/media/2017/12/22/USATODAY/USATODAY/636495518638126875-EPA-BRITAIN-ROYALTY.jpg?width=1918&height=1084&fit=crop&format=pjpg&auto=webp", "https://www.usatoday.com/gcdn/-mm-/9850e0c9b56ed77075c9ca7090ddcaf7e07760ce/c=0-72-599-671/local/-/media/2018/12/11/USATODAY/USATODAY/636801428333177424-sara-Moniuszko.png?width=48&height=48&fit=crop&format=pjpg&auto=webp", "https://www.usatoday.com/gcdn/-mm-/f4195330fbce0fa6277d8c7365bf764010ed1602/c=0-0-2995-1692/local/-/media/2017/12/22/USATODAY/USATODAY/636495555535977787-AP-BRITAIN-ROYAL-ASCOT.jpg?width=660&height=373&fit=crop&format=pjpg&auto=webp"], "top_img": "https://www.usatoday.com/gcdn/-mm-/4b4579eae006e8af8dc4e54bf4514a796cea1f87/c=1756-429-3674-1513/local/-/media/2017/12/22/USATODAY/USATODAY/636495518638126875-EPA-BRITAIN-ROYALTY.jpg?width=1918&height=1084&fit=crop&format=pjpg&auto=webp", "keywords": [], "authors": [], "canonical_link": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/life/people/2017/12/22/princess-michael-kent-apologizes-wearing-racist-brooch-front-meghan-markle/977796001/", "title": "Princess Michael of Kent apologizes for wearing 'racist' brooch in front of Meghan Markle", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1,minimum-scale=1", "theme-color": "#0098FE", "og": {"title": "Princess Michael of Kent apologizes for wearing 'racist' brooch in front of Meghan Markle", "description": "Princess Michael of Kent, who is married to the queen's first cousin, was criticized for wearing a\u00a0blackamoor brooch in front of Meghan Markle.", "url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/life/people/2017/12/22/princess-michael-kent-apologizes-wearing-racist-brooch-front-meghan-markle/977796001/", "site_name": "USA TODAY", "image": {"identifier": "https://www.usatoday.com/gcdn/-mm-/4b4579eae006e8af8dc4e54bf4514a796cea1f87/c=1756-429-3674-1513/local/-/media/2017/12/22/USATODAY/USATODAY/636495518638126875-EPA-BRITAIN-ROYALTY.jpg?width=1918&height=1084&fit=crop&format=pjpg&auto=webp", "width": 1918, "height": 1084}, "type": "article"}, "article": {"author": "Sara M Moniuszko", "content_tier": "free", "opinion": "false"}, "description": "Princess Michael of Kent, who is married to the queen's first cousin, was criticized for wearing a\u00a0blackamoor brooch in front of Meghan Markle.", "fb": {"pages": "13652355666,48958576760,156345381090801,110471702456365,6566864515,137698179626815,315942225236045,927427260614748,183850168300771,1443524575938047,251228454889939,158095147555989,115535341805950,236655713446291,1621466394844549,250325640686,177037772444433,1972936962947967,2047091012096533,535551216797440", "app_id": 215046668549694}, "ROBOTS": "NOODP, NOYDIR, max-image-preview:large", "google": "notranslate", "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "image": "https://www.usatoday.com/gcdn/-mm-/4b4579eae006e8af8dc4e54bf4514a796cea1f87/c=1756-429-3674-1513/local/-/media/2017/12/22/USATODAY/USATODAY/636495518638126875-EPA-BRITAIN-ROYALTY.jpg?width=1600&height=800&fit=crop&format=pjpg&auto=webp", "site": "@usatoday", "creator": "@usatoday", "title": "Princess Michael of Kent apologizes for wearing 'racist' brooch in front of Meghan Markle", "description": "Princess Michael of Kent, who is married to the queen's first cousin, was criticized for wearing a\u00a0blackamoor brooch in front of Meghan Markle."}}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1513872000.0, "source": "https://www.usatoday.com", "summary": ""}

{"url": "https://www.thewrap.com/logan-paul-second-chances/", "text": "You won\u2019t confuse his remarks with the Dalai Lama or Nelson Mandela, but disgraced YouTube star Logan Paul has a message of compassion, following his widely-denounced video that showed the body of a suicide victim in Japan.\n\n\u201cEveryone deserves second chances, bro,\u201d said Paul, as he walked past a TMZ reporter at LAX on Tuesday (see video below).\n\nThe 22-year-old has been under heavy scrutiny since posting a video titled \u201cWe found a dead body in the Japanese suicide forest\u201d that showed a corpse hanging from a tree in Aokigahara forest near Mt. Fuji. Paul took down the clip a day later, after it had already garnered at least 6 million views. He issued an apology, followed by a second apology, in the aftermath.\n\nPaul added to the TMZ cameraman he\u2019s learned \u201ceverything, so many things\u201d from the fallout.\n\nAdding to the public skewering he received, YouTube told TheWrap last week Paul would be pulled from starring on the platform\u2019s original series \u201cFoursome.\u201d Upcoming YouTube projects have been put on hold, and Paul was stripped of his Google Preferred status, which helps advertisers identify top content and purchase easy-to-buy ad packages.\n\nPaul didn\u2019t have much to say about YouTube to TMZ. He nodded when asked if he\u2019d been treated fairly by the video giant and the public, and said he has a message \u201ccoming\u201d regarding YouTube\u2019s decision.", "images": ["https://i0.wp.com/www.thewrap.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Activision-Blizzard.jpg?resize=320%2C180&ssl=1", "https://i0.wp.com/www.thewrap.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Mortal-Kombat-1.jpeg?resize=320%2C180&ssl=1", "https://i0.wp.com/www.thewrap.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/x-GettyImages-1567327082-e1691513581906.jpg?resize=320%2C180&ssl=1", "https://i0.wp.com/www.thewrap.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Sean-Burch.png?fit=53%2C58&ssl=1", "https://i0.wp.com/www.thewrap.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/RS1R6094-scaled.jpg?resize=320%2C180&ssl=1", "https://www.thewrap.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/logan-1.jpg", "https://i0.wp.com/www.thewrap.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Sean-Burch.png?resize=150%2C150&ssl=1", "https://i0.wp.com/www.thewrap.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Succession-EmmyWrap-Drama-Cover-1.jpg?fit=250%2C300&ssl=1", "https://i0.wp.com/www.thewrap.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/logan-1.jpg?fit=618%2C412&ssl=1"], "top_img": "https://www.thewrap.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/logan-1.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Sean Burch", "Jeremy Bailey", "Benjamin Lindsay", "Josh Dickey", "Umberto Gonzalez", "Tech Reporter", "Sean.Burch Thewrap.Com", ".Wp-Block-Post-Author Display Flex Flex-Wrap Wrap .Wp-Block-Post-Author__Byline Font-Size Margin-Bottom Margin-Top Width", ".Wp-Block-Post-Author__Avatar Margin-Right .Wp-Block-Post-Author__Bio Font-Size Margin-Bottom .Wp-Block-Post-Author__Content Flex-Basis Flex-Grow .Wp-Block-Post-Author__Name Margin", ".Wp-Block-Post-Author Font-Family Libre-Franklin Sans-Serif Font-Size Line-Height Align-Items Center Letter-Spacing White-Space Pre .Wp-Block-Post-Author A Color"], "canonical_link": "https://www.thewrap.com/logan-paul-second-chances/", "title": "Logan Paul: \u2018Everyone Deserves Second Chances, Bro\u2019 (Video)", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "robots": "index, follow, max-image-preview:large, max-snippet:-1, max-video-preview:-1", "og": {"locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "Logan Paul: 'Everyone Deserves Second Chances, Bro' (Video) - TheWrap", "description": "YouTube star says he's learned \"everything, so many things\" after posting controversial video", "url": "https://www.thewrap.com/logan-paul-second-chances/", "site_name": "TheWrap", "image": {"identifier": "https://www.thewrap.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/logan-1.jpg", "width": 618, "height": 412, "type": "image/jpeg"}}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/thewrap", "published_time": "2018-01-16T17:05:41+00:00"}, "author": "Sean Burch", "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@SeanB44", "site": "@thewrap", "label1": "Written by", "data1": "Sean Burch", "label2": "Est. reading time", "data2": "1 minute"}, "generator": "WordPress 6.2.3", "parsely-title": "Logan Paul: \u2018Everyone Deserves Second Chances, Bro\u2019 (Video)", "parsely-link": "https://www.thewrap.com/logan-paul-second-chances/", "parsely-type": "post", "parsely-pub-date": "2018-01-16T09:05:41-08:00", "parsely-section": "tech", "parsely-author": "Sean Burch", "parsely-tags": "google, jake-paul, logan-paul, youtube", "msapplication-TileImage": "https://i0.wp.com/www.thewrap.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/thewrap-site-icon-1.png?fit=270%2C270&ssl=1"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1516122341.0, "source": "https://www.thewrap.com", "summary": ""}

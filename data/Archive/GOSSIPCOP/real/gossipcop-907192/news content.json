{"url": "https://mashable.com/article/stranger-things-david-harbour-fan-wedding/", "text": "David Harbour is back on his \"man of the fanpeople\" bullshit, which is great news for anyone who likes Jim Hopper and uplifting stories.\n\nThe Stranger Things star took to Twitter on Saturday with a message for his followers and a heartwarming photo. It featured Harbour, dressed in his Hopper duds from the Netflix series, standing with a joyous wedding party.\n\n\"Hey internet. I know it\u2019s been awhile. I retreated. Needed some space. You probably get it. But I\u2019ve been thinking about ya in the interim. And all your retweets. And so me and some fun folks in Springfield, Illinois made good on our promise we made all those months ago,\" the tweet read.\n\n(Important author's note: Harbour puts two spaces after every period because he is clearly the Demogorgon in human form.)\n\nFor those who might need a refresher: Harbour, who seems like a genuinely good dude, isn't just one of the happier success stories to come out of Netflix's hit series. He's also there for his fans. So much so that he posed for high school yearbook photos with one and agreed to officiate the wedding of another.\n\nThe latter pledge appears to be the source of this photo. Harbour made his wedding promise back in January, for nuptials that were scheduled to happen in September.\n\nWell, it's September now.\n\nWhile Harbour's new tweet doesn't identify the bride (or anyone in the photo) by name, one of the responses he got is from a woman claiming to be \"Ericka's\" sister. Sure, that could just be an internet troll hoping to draw a celebrity's attention. But it's much more likely that she's on the level, and this photo is the result of Harbour following through on his January promise.\n\nWe still have a great many months to go before Stranger Things Season 3 surfaces, so just add moments like this from Harbour's real life to your Jim Hopper headcanon.", "images":

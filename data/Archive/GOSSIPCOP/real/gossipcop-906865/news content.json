But he makes sure to assert that Jackson is totally not mad at him.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know that a lot of people know that [me and Janet made peace],\" he claims. \"I mean I don\u2019t think it\u2019s my job to do that, because you value the relationships that you do have with people.\u201d\n\nIt's important to note that Jackson has not publicly commented on her feelings towards Timberlake in recent history.\n\nAfter the incident, she was not only forced to apologize and take full blame, but was also barred from award shows -- like that year's Grammys (Timberlake still attended) -- and also had her music blacklisted from the most influential radio stations and TV networks of the time (Timberlake did not).\n\nIn a 2006 MTV interview, long after it could actually help Jackson, Timberlake expressed regret that he'd failed to stand by her while she suffered the lion's share of the consequences.\n\nBut in the age of #FreeTheNipple campaigns and the Time's Up initiative, we can now look back at the clear misogyny and racism at play. The public vilified Jackson, pinning the supposed moral degradation of society on a single (briefly) exposed nipple.\n\nAnd those who clamored to shame and blame her didn't once stop to ask, \"Hang on -- wasn't it Timberlake who actually, physically ripped off the costume? And didn't Jackson look shocked and mortified about it before immediately running off stage?\"\n\nThere's still a lot of mystery around what exactly happened. But you know what isn't a mystery? The reason why Timberlake's career continued to soar, while Jackson's never came close to recovering.\n\nFourteen years later, and Timberlake has been invited back with open arms to the scene of the Nipplegate crime. But where's Janet Jackson's big comeback halftime show?\n\nFeatured Video For You Seth Meyers slays Golden Globes monologue then gives women the mic", "images": ["https://helios-i.mashable.com/imagery/authors/06G8TvncwEZB0cBDQTzP2l3/image.fill.size_100x100.v1624381002.jpg", "https://helios-i.mashable.com/imagery/articles/01HWM6gYMPPEcbd5E5VbGPz/hero-image.fill.size_220x133.v1697535391.jpg", "https://helios-i.mashable.com/imagery/articles/02snqm96ebvUmviivdTmXGV/hero-image.fill.size_220x220.v1697195938.jpg", "https://helios-i.mashable.com/imagery/articles/04OVqEjyrOiYy4IzEDFa45K/hero-image.fill.size_220x220.v1697212402.jpg", "https://helios-i.mashable.com/imagery/articles/06lVvMnhKsoU8UbrLj4Aafz/hero-image.fill.size_220x220.v1697182009.jpg", "https://helios-i.mashable.com/imagery/articles/04ZLGD4PvJC7eS6adqRfb3I/hero-image.fill.size_220x220.v1697469806.png", "https://helios-i.mashable.com/imagery/articles/04ZLGD4PvJC7eS6adqRfb3I/hero-image.fill.size_220x133.v1697469806.png", "https://helios-i.mashable.com/imagery/articles/01N44EUzRFSX7NIEpK5yWEc/hero-image.fill.size_220x133.v1696576810.jpg", "https://helios-i.mashable.com/imagery/articles/02eviSUbSvUsIRIW8RLts6H/hero-image.fill.size_220x220.v1696947617.jpg", "https://helios-i.mashable.com/imagery/articles/01XLJdA08LNT92HhhC7OPIU/hero-image.fill.size_220x133.v1697037466.jpg", "https://helios-i.mashable.com/imagery/articles/01LrJDjKTepvGh6QPCbxPht/hero-image.fill.size_220x220.v1697227105.jpg", "https://helios-i.mashable.com/imagery/articles/02snqm96ebvUmviivdTmXGV/hero-image.fill.size_220x133.v1697195938.jpg", "https://helios-i.mashable.com/imagery/articles/02Asi5Crk2TEzDuOFtNrMvA/hero-image.fill.size_220x133.v1696861225.jpg", "https://helios-i.mashable.com/imagery/articles/01HWM6gYMPPEcbd5E5VbGPz/hero-image.fill.size_220x220.v1697535391.jpg", "https://helios-i.mashable.com/imagery/articles/02eviSUbSvUsIRIW8RLts6H/hero-image.fill.size_220x133.v1696947617.jpg", "https://helios-i.mashable.com/imagery/articles/02Asi5Crk2TEzDuOFtNrMvA/hero-image.fill.size_220x220.v1696861225.jpg", "https://helios-i.mashable.com/imagery/articles/04OVqEjyrOiYy4IzEDFa45K/hero-image.fill.size_220x133.v1697212402.jpg", "https://c.evidon.com/pub/icong1.png", "https://helios-i.mashable.com/imagery/articles/01XLJdA08LNT92HhhC7OPIU/hero-image.fill.size_220x220.v1697037466.jpg", "https://helios-i.mashable.com/imagery/articles/06lVvMnhKsoU8UbrLj4Aafz/hero-image.fill.size_220x133.v1697182009.jpg", "https://helios-i.mashable.com/imagery/articles/01N44EUzRFSX7NIEpK5yWEc/hero-image.fill.size_220x220.v1696576810.jpg", "https://mashable.com/images/group-black-logo-purple.png", "https://helios-i.mashable.com/imagery/articles/00f1xrgv2fDQO7wUBhrCE7v/hero-image.fill.size_1248x702.v1623368550.jpg", "https://helios-i.mashable.com/imagery/articles/00f1xrgv2fDQO7wUBhrCE7v/hero-image.fill.size_1200x675.v1623368550.jpg", "https://helios-i.mashable.com/imagery/articles/01LrJDjKTepvGh6QPCbxPht/hero-image.fill.size_220x133.v1697227105.jpg"], "top_img": "https://helios-i.mashable.com/imagery/articles/00f1xrgv2fDQO7wUBhrCE7v/hero-image.fill.size_1200x675.v1623368550.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": [], "canonical_link": "https://mashable.com/article/justin-timberlake-janet-jackson-super-bowl-nipplegate", "title": "Justin Timberlake admits he 'stumbled' during the 'Nipplegate' controversy", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "theme-color": "#00aeef", "application-name": "Mashable.com", "description": "Remember this sexist BS?", "fb": {"app_id": 122071082108, "pages": 18807449704}, "og": {"site_name": "Mashable", "title": "Justin Timberlake admits he 'stumbled' during the 'Nipplegate' controversy", "url": "https://mashable.com/article/justin-timberlake-janet-jackson-super-bowl-nipplegate", "description": "Remember this sexist BS?", "image": {"identifier": "https://helios-i.mashable.com/imagery/articles/00f1xrgv2fDQO7wUBhrCE7v/hero-image.fill.size_1200x675.v1623368550.jpg", "secure_url": "https://helios-i.mashable.com/imagery/articles/00f1xrgv2fDQO7wUBhrCE7v/hero-image.fill.size_1200x675.v1623368550.jpg", "height": 675, "width": 1200}, "type": "article", "article": {"tag": "Music"}}, "article": {"author": "Jess Joho", "modified_time": "2021-10-29T15:36:15+00:00", "published_time": "2018-01-17T21:27:08+00:00", "section": "Entertainment"}, "twitter": {"site": "@mashable", "card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@mashable", "title": "Justin Timberlake admits he 'stumbled' during the 'Nipplegate' controversy", "description": "Remember this sexist BS?", "image": "https://helios-i.mashable.com/imagery/articles/00f1xrgv2fDQO7wUBhrCE7v/hero-image.fill.size_1200x675.v1623368550.jpg"}, "robots": "max-image-preview:large"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1516118400.0, "source": "https://mashable.com", "summary": ""}

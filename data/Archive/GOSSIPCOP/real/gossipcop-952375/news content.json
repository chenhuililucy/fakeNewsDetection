Now, Luann's co-stars Dorinda Medley and Tinsley Mortimer share their thoughts on Luann's relapse and show their support for the former Countess.Tinsley revealed that she was \"totally in shock\" when she heard about Lu's struggles during her appearance on Watch What Happens Live with Andy Cohen Wednesday night.Tinsley went on to say that she was proud to see Luann come out on top after her arrest in Palm Beach, Florida last Christmas Eve, just as she had done following her own brush with the law in 2016. \"I had a mugshot in Palm Beach, too, and I just feel like I turned it around, and I felt like she was doing that. I felt like the cabaret show is so amazing, and I was just so proud of her,\" Tinsley said. \"It's just sad. I wish her the best, and I hope she can work everything out.\"\"It's so sad that she's not here. I feel so badly for her. I really had no idea that it is as serious, I guess, as it is, and I feel really sad for her, and I hope she gets well. And she's taking obviously the right steps to do so,\" Tinsley toldprior to filming the reunion. \"A relapse happens all the time and is part of sort of the program of it. So we'll see, and hopefully she can get out of it, be happy, and be fine.\"Dorinda shared that she heard the news about Luann at the same time everyone else did earlier this week. \"I literally cried over it. I cried when I heard,\" Dorinda told Bravo's. \"I wrote her a text, a quick text, but I haven't heard back, so I'm just gonna pray for her, think about her. She's here in thought.\"She also added about Luann not attending this season's reunion, \"I really feel bad that Lu's not gonna be there.\"Meanwhile, Luann also got some love and support for the OG of the OC herself, Vicki Gunvalson.\"That makes me sad,\" the Real Housewives of Orange County star told. \"I think the whole exposure of going out and trying to stay sober and not have a cocktail when you have an issue is really difficult\u2014especially in the social scene that we're all in. So I'm sorry to hear that.\"Vicki also touched on the \"pressure\" the women of the Real Housewives franchise face, saying it's extremely difficult to strike a balance between the life you lead when cameras aren't rolling and when filming picks up again.\"There's a lot of pressure trying to manage your business and your personal life and your show life,\" Vicki said. \"It's like you have three or four different lives that you're trying to blend together.\"Photo Credit: Bravo", "images": ["https://images.dmca.com/Badges/DMCA_logo-grn-btn200w.png?ID=2813e687-3ffc-439f-8264-27d1f26efb63",

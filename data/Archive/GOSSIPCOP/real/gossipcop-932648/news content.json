I was speechless. I didn\u2019t really say anything,\u201d said McCune in an exclusive interview with 12 news.\n\nThe third grade student has been in the hospital undergoing a painful recovery after getting third-degree burns in over 65 percent of her body. However, McCune has used Swift\u2019s music as inspiration and way to help her get through the excruciating treatments. She wanted to go to Swift's show in Glendale Tuesday, but her condition made it impossible to leave the hospital, so made a special plea to Swift to come visit her, and it worked!\n\n\u201cShe\u2019s really nice,\u201d said McCune.\n\nSwift brought her all sorts of swag from her Reputation tour, which kicks off in Glendale on Tuesday. Taylor also posed with Isabella and her family for some pictures, but Isabella says her favorite moment during the 30 minute visit was getting a hug from Taylor.\n\n\u201cShe was about to leave and I said \u2018Taylor, can I have a hug?\u2019 And she said, \u2018Yeah! I just didn\u2019t want to hurt you.\u2019\u201d\n\nSwift also wrote an encouraging letter on Isabella\u2019s memory book. It says \u201cIsabella! I hope you feel better soon, and I\u2019m so honored you\u2019ve been listening to my music. You\u2019re so awesome and I can\u2019t wait to have you at a show!! Stay Strong. gorgeous\u201d\n\nTaylor invited her to one of her concerts once she recovers.\n\n\u201cShe was just so natural. She was just a breath of fresh air,\u201d said Lilly McCune, Isabella\u2019s mom.\n\n\u201cI just said when she left, \u2018thank you for coming and seeing me\u2019,\u201d said Isabella.", "images": ["https://media.wkyc.com/assets/WKYC/images/f236e94a-cbe7-4875-91aa-253f9893e5a4/f236e94a-cbe7-4875-91aa-253f9893e5a4_360x203.jpg", "https://www.wkyc.com/assets/shared-images/weather-icons/cloudy-day_210x210.png", "https://www.wkyc.com/assets/shared-images/logos/native/wkyc.svg", "https://media.wkyc.com/assets/KPNX/images/c98095e4-30df-4d70-8956-2e3e97de46f5/c98095e4-30df-4d70-8956-2e3e97de46f5_16x9.jpg", "https://media.wkyc.com/assets/WKYC/images/b633b0d2-1419-424c-9046-4faa13d622d2/b633b0d2-1419-424c-9046-4faa13d622d2_360x203.jpg", "https://www.wkyc.com/assets/shared-images/icons/twitter.svg", "https://media.wkyc.com/assets/WKYC/images/7b50739c-8720-4004-869d-2a0421377b77/7b50739c-8720-4004-869d-2a0421377b77_16x9.jpg", "https://media.wkyc.com/assets/KPNX/images/51e1ace8-85df-4941-afb8-8efec4c0c663/51e1ace8-85df-4941-afb8-8efec4c0c663_1920x1080.jpg", "https://www.wkyc.com/assets/shared-images/icons/facebook.svg", "https://media.wkyc.com/assets/WKYC/images/f236e94a-cbe7-4875-91aa-253f9893e5a4/f236e94a-cbe7-4875-91aa-253f9893e5a4_16x9.jpg", "https://www.wkyc.com/assets/shared-images/icons/close-menu.svg", "https://media.wkyc.com/assets/WKYC/images/7b50739c-8720-4004-869d-2a0421377b77/7b50739c-8720-4004-869d-2a0421377b77_360x203.jpg", "https://media.wkyc.com/assets/KPNX/images/c98095e4-30df-4d70-8956-2e3e97de46f5/c98095e4-30df-4d70-8956-2e3e97de46f5_360x203.jpg", "https://media.wkyc.com/assets/KPNX/images/a631b8ac-e8e6-4992-a2f3-846ea92903a5/a631b8ac-e8e6-4992-a2f3-846ea92903a5_1920x1080.jpg", "https://media.wkyc.com/assets/KPNX/images/549294247/549294247_1140x641.jpg", "https://www.wkyc.com/assets/shared-images/logos/wkyc.png", "https://media.wkyc.com/assets/WKYC/images/b633b0d2-1419-424c-9046-4faa13d622d2/b633b0d2-1419-424c-9046-4faa13d622d2_16x9.jpg"], "top_img": "https://media.wkyc.com/assets/KPNX/images/549294247/549294247_1140x641.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": [], "canonical_link": "https://www.12news.com/article/life/heartwarming/taylor-swift-visits-8-year-old-phoenix-burn-survivor-in-hospital/75-549293673", "title": "Taylor Swift visits 8-year-old Phoenix burn survivor in hospital", "meta_data": {"theme-color": "#d81f32", "category": "life", "og": {"url": "https://www.wkyc.com/article/life/heartwarming/taylor-swift-visits-8-year-old-phoenix-burn-survivor-in-hospital/75-549293673", "title": "Taylor Swift visits 8-year-old Phoenix burn survivor in hospital", "description": "Isabella won't be able to go to Taylor Swift's Tuesday show in Glendale, so the singer came to her.", "type": "article", "image": {"identifier": "https://media.wkyc.com/assets/KPNX/images/549294247/549294247_1140x641.jpg", "width": 1140, "height": 641}, "article": {"published_time": "5/5/2018 7:59:18 PM"}, "site_name": "wkyc.com", "locale": "en_US"}, "article": {"opinion": "false", "content_tier": "free", "section": "wkyc,life,heartwarming,285_entertainment,285_features"}, "twitter": {"title": "Taylor Swift visits 8-year-old Phoenix burn survivor in hospital", "image": "https://media.wkyc.com/assets/KPNX/images/549294247/549294247_1140x641.jpg", "card": "summary_large_image", "site": "wkyc", "description": "Isabella won't be able to go to Taylor Swift's Tuesday show in Glendale, so the singer came to her.", "domain": "www.wkyc.com/"}, "viewport": "width=1170", "site": "wkyc.com", "description": "Isabella won't be able to go to Taylor Swift's Tuesday show in Glendale, so the singer came to her.", "fb": {"app_id": 145836432870387}, "robots": "max-image-preview:large"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1525521558.0, "source": "https://www.wkyc.com", "summary": ""}

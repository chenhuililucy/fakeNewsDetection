Only a few repairs to the roof and other minor stuff.\n\nThe brand new security system they left behind probably spiked the price.", "images": ["https://imagez.tmz.com/image/15/16by9/2015/01/16/153f949fc3f45ca9b0d33d810b5b1114_xs.jpg", "https://imagez.tmz.com/image/e4/4by3/2023/10/16/e4b52a0228f847ffa4c4167f24f6c2c8_md.jpg", "https://imagez.tmz.com/image/52/16by9/2023/10/17/52339164f59f48469e1d662826922692_xs.jpg", "https://imagez.tmz.com/image/10/4by3/2023/10/17/10a88eb75d38433097a7f603dd3b3c88_md.jpg", "https://imagez.tmz.com/image/68/4by3/2023/10/17/68a1a46104e643299f62e86ad3ab5416_md.jpg", "https://imagez.tmz.com/image/a2/4by3/2023/10/17/a29d96ebd3fb41b687b75d1346bd77fb_md.jpg", "https://imagez.tmz.com/image/fc/4by3/2023/10/17/fcb233b65a6c431787de51ff397550f6_md.jpg", "https://imagez.tmz.com/image/5e/16by9/2023/10/17/5e2617210778468eaa7759a4e768b4c0_xs.jpg", "https://imagez.tmz.com/image/db/16by9/2023/10/17/db8e004f267d498a9f1b8d42c40c5a84_xs.png", "https://static.tmz.com/tmz-web/img/thirtymilezone.svg", "https://imagez.tmz.com/image/5e/4by3/2023/10/17/5e0fc9bae688453683ba9767252c32d7_md.jpg", "https://imagez.tmz.com/image/52/16by9/2023/10/16/52cfd9854e684a2bb674e5c4051ba328_xs.jpg", "https://imagez.tmz.com/image/c4/4by3/2023/10/17/c436c9885ad2472db1ca9cfae47af3f5_md.png", "https://imagez.tmz.com/image/eb/16by9/2023/10/17/eb62fb5aa3aa4ae4a26e8c191736a48a_xs.jpg", "https://imagez.tmz.com/image/b9/4by3/2023/10/17/b93f1088bd5a45aa865e83e84545bd5b_md.jpg", "https://imagez.tmz.com/image/74/4by3/2023/10/17/740cbd6e2ab94ecd8b3bdd888ea5e4f1_md.jpg", "https://imagez.tmz.com/image/6a/4by3/2023/10/17/6a41b492bdf1477b96ddfb600e74cb85_md.jpg", "https://imagez.tmz.com/image/e1/16by9/2014/10/25/e11f2eb756c650b68b30459e4519658f_xs.jpg", "https://imagez.tmz.com/image/c1/4by3/2023/10/17/c117e458a5284a30972effa0fb31820e_md.jpg", "https://imagez.tmz.com/image/21/4by3/2023/10/17/211e8194f0c54cc5b6c4065d3c37930f_md.jpg", "https://imagez.tmz.com/image/6b/4by3/2023/10/17/6bb78416b00843bdb2002c6bca45aae7_md.jpg", "https://imagez.tmz.com/image/e2/4by3/2023/10/17/e28cf81f227f4610b589d9b75bd072ae_md.jpg", "https://imagez.tmz.com/image/4e/16by9/2015/06/19/4ea842c644565d0691740a88734990cf_xl.jpg", "https://imagez.tmz.com/image/9b/16by9/2015/02/13/9bbd4eab21675d37aeb926579cba5e56_xs.jpg", "https://imagez.tmz.com/image/29/4by3/2023/10/17/294348faa012460b8b10820a056a6842_md.jpg", "https://imagez.tmz.com/image/db/4by3/2023/10/17/db8e004f267d498a9f1b8d42c40c5a84_md.png", "https://imagez.tmz.com/image/a2/o/2015/06/19/a24a5f404dbc52deb92bc8f03ebf4558_md.jpg"], "top_img": "https://imagez.tmz.com/image/4e/16by9/2015/06/19/4ea842c644565d0691740a88734990cf_xl.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": [], "canonical_link": "https://www.tmz.com/2015/06/21/honey-boo-boo-georgia-mama-june-house-sale-tlc/", "title": "'Honey Boo Boo' House Hits The Market ...

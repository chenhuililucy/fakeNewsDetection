Entertainment, he lobbied for the Grammy-winning superstar to appear in Disney\u2019s musical blockbuster.\n\n\u201cI even tried to get her into \u2018Beauty and the Beast,\u2019 but it wasn\u2019t a big enough part,\u201d the 61-year-old director said. \u201cShe would have been a good feather duster.\u201d\n\nCondon, who worked with Beyonc\u00e9, 36, in 2006\u2019s \u201cDreamgirls,\u201d helmed the live action version of the Disney classic, which has grossed a total of $504 million domestically. The role of Plumette, the feather duster of Lumiere\u2019s (Ewan McGregor) eye, went to British actress Gugu Mbatha-Raw.\n\nThough Beyonc\u00e9\u2019s resume has grown since \u201cDreamgirls,\u201d Condon believes the mother of three has an eye for the future of filmmaking.\n\n\u201cYou look at something like \u2018Lemonade\u2018: that is brilliant,\u201d he says. \u201cThat is a brilliant new direction for movie musicals.\u201d", "images": ["https://nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2019/09/p6podcast402x.png", "https://pagesix.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2023/10/NYPICHPDPICT000055127271.jpg?w=93&h=62&crop=1", "https://decider.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Jada-Pinkett-Smith-on-Today-With-HOda-Jenna.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&w=322&h=215&crop=1", "https://pagesix.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2023/10/NYPICHPDPICT000061715049.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&w=87", "https://pagesix.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2023/10/britney-spears-justin-timberlake-2.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&w=87", "https://pagesix.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2023/10/britney-spears-shaved-head.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&w=260&h=174&crop=1", "https://pagesix.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2023/10/NYPICHPDPICT000061709727.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&w=260&h=174&crop=1", "https://pagesix.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2023/10/NYPICHPDPICT000061750708.jpg?w=93&h=62&crop=1", "https://googleads.g.doubleclick.net/pagead/viewthroughconversion/988380111/?value=0&guid=ON&script=0", "https://pagesix.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2023/10/taylor-luggage-1.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&w=87", "https://pagesix.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2023/10/taylor-luggage-1.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&w=260&h=174&crop=1", "https://nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2019/09/apple-podcast-badge402x.png", "https://pagesix.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2023/10/britney-spears-shaved-head.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&w=87", "https://pagesix.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2017/10/beyonce2.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&w=744", "https://nypost.com/wp-content/mu-plugins/vip-helpers/images/vip-powered-dark-small.png", "https://pagesix.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2023/10/NYPICHPDPICT000061704968.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&w=87", "https://pagesix.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2017/10/beyonce2.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&w=1024", "https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6390601&c3=PAGESIX&cj=1&cv=3.6", "https://pagesix.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2023/10/NYPICHPDPICT000061747210.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&w=93&h=62&crop=1", "https://pagesix.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2023/10/NYPICHPDPICT000061709727.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&w=87", "https://pagesix.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2023/10/Untitled-2-3.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&w=87", "https://pagesix.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2023/10/NYPICHPDPICT000061710564.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&w=93&h=62&crop=1", "https://pagesix.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2023/10/britney-spears-justin-timberlake-2.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&w=260&h=174&crop=1", "https://pagesix.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2023/10/NYPICHPDPICT000006227224.jpg?w=93&h=62&crop=1", "https://pagesix.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2023/10/taylor-swift-travis-kelce-shania-twain-shirt.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&w=87", "https://pagesix.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2023/10/skims-style-trial-split.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&1697539602&w=93&h=62&crop=1", "https://pagesix.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2023/10/NYPICHPDPICT000061445330.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&w=93&h=62&crop=1", "https://pagesix.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2023/10/NYPICHPDPICT000061745692.jpg?w=93&h=62&crop=1"], "top_img": "https://pagesix.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2017/10/beyonce2.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&w=1024", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Social Links For Jaclyn Hendricks", "Contact The Author"], "canonical_link": "https://pagesix.com/2017/10/18/beyonce-turned-down-a-role-in-beauty-and-the-beast/", "title": "Beyonc\u00e9 turned down a role in \u2018Beauty and the Beast\u2019", "meta_data": {"copyright": "Copyright 2023 NYP Holdings.

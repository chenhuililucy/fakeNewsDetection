Savenok/Getty Images for The Weinstein Company\n\nAlyssa Milano says she waited a few days to comment on the Harvey Weinstein allegations out of respect for Weinstein\u2019s now-estranged wife, Georgina Chapman. In a blog post on her website, Patriot Not Partisan, Milano wrote on Monday that she stands with Weinstein\u2019s alleged victims. But speaking out against Weinstein, she added, \u201cis complicated for me for personal reasons.\u201d\n\n\u201cHarvey has a wife, who I have had the privilege of working with for the last 5 years on Project Runway All Stars,\u201d Milano explained. \u201cGeorgina Chapman is my friend. She is one of the most special humans I have ever met. Harvey and Georgina also have two very young children who my children have known their entire lives. It is because of my love for Georgina, India and Dashiell that I haven\u2019t publicly commented on this until now. Please don\u2019t confuse my silence for anything other than respect for a dear friend and her beautiful children.\u201d\n\n7 High-Profile Men Accused Of Sexual Harassment Over The Past Year\n\nAfter publishing her post, Milano retweeted a photo with the words \u201cI Stand With Rose,\u201d referencing her Charmed co-star Rose McGowan, who settled with Weinstein after an \u201cepisode\u201d in a hotel room in 1997.\n\nProject Runway All Stars was produced by the Weinstein Company. Milano served as a host, and Chapman, who co-founded the fashion line Marchesa, served as a judge. Chapman announced on Tuesday that she is leaving Weinstein.", "images": ["https://assets.nymag.com/media/components/customer-alert-banner/alert.svg", "https://pyxis.nymag.com/v1/imgs/fd1/2c2/0cceaf7f8ea65d263a2a1419e4776b9965-2123Cov-4x5-GOP-Primary.w240.jpg", "https://pyxis.nymag.com/v1/imgs/8df/879/45409a2249f67ed3cddf3f0df1579b35f9-teens-antiaging-skincare.2x.rsquare-zoom.w75.jpg", "https://assets.nymag.com/media/components/customer-alert-banner/double_chevron.svg", "https://pyxis.nymag.com/v1/imgs/5c0/935/de88b18067b9ca9b0c3748cf0b91ea97cc-passages-back-1.2x.rsquare-zoom.w75.jpg", "https://pyxis.nymag.com/v1/imgs/305/4b0/de42bd377c2dfcff8887b3311621dd8921-Esther.2x.rsquare-zoom.w75.jpg ", "https://pyxis.nymag.com/v1/imgs/f2a/d1a/48cb306033837e77bc65398d2398a15999-11-Alyssa-Milano-Georgina-Chapman.1x.rsocial.w1200.jpg", "https://assets.nymag.com/media/components/customer-alert-banner/close_x.svg", "https://pyxis.nymag.com/v1/imgs/f2a/d1a/48cb306033837e77bc65398d2398a15999-11-Alyssa-Milano-Georgina-Chapman.rvertical.w330.jpg"], "top_img": "https://pyxis.nymag.com/v1/imgs/f2a/d1a/48cb306033837e77bc65398d2398a15999-11-Alyssa-Milano-Georgina-Chapman.1x.rsocial.w1200.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Allie Jones", "A Freelance Writer Who Covers Celebrity", "Culture"], "canonical_link": "https://www.thecut.com/2017/10/harvey-weinstein-allegations-alyssa-milano.html", "title": "Alyssa Milano Explains Why She Didn\u2019t Comment On Weinstein", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1,shrink-to-fit=no", "parsely-tags": "the harvey weinstein case, harvey weinstein, alyssa milano, georgina chapman, project runway, featuretype:news-commentary and analysis", "og": {"title": "Alyssa Milano Explains Why She Didn\u2019t Comment on Weinstein", "url": "https://www.thecut.com/2017/10/harvey-weinstein-allegations-alyssa-milano.html", "description": "She starred on the Weinstein-produced Project Runway All Stars with his wife, Georgina Chapman.", "image": "https://pyxis.nymag.com/v1/imgs/f2a/d1a/48cb306033837e77bc65398d2398a15999-11-Alyssa-Milano-Georgina-Chapman.1x.rsocial.w1200.jpg", "site_name": "The Cut", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"title": "Alyssa Milano Explains Why She Didn\u2019t Comment on Weinstein", "description": "She starred on the Weinstein-produced Project Runway All Stars with his wife, Georgina Chapman.", "image": "https://pyxis.nymag.com/v1/imgs/f2a/d1a/48cb306033837e77bc65398d2398a15999-11-Alyssa-Milano-Georgina-Chapman.2x.rsocial.w600.jpg", "card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@allierileyjones", "site": "@TheCut"}, "article": {"published_time": "2017-10-11T12:42:10.953-04:00", "tag": "the harvey weinstein case, harvey weinstein, alyssa milano, georgina chapman, project runway", "publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/cut"}, "description": "Alyssa Milano starred on the Weinstein-produced Project Runway: All Stars with Weinstein\u2019s wife Georgina Chapman.", "robots": "max-image-preview:large", "sailthru.tags": "the harvey weinstein case, harvey weinstein, alyssa milano, georgina chapman, project runway", "author": "Allie Jones", "fb": {"app_id": 343556435754245}, "type": "Article", "vertical": "The Cut", "sectionOverride": "The Cut", "apple-mobile-web-app-title": "The Cut", "application-name": "The Cut", "msapplication-TileColor": "#ff5656", "msapplication-TileImage": "https://assets.thecut.com/media/sites/thecut/icon.144x144.png"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1507740130.953, "source": "https://www.thecut.com", "summary": ""}

From meeting while Meghan was working as an actor to getting married, having two cute babies, and leaving the British royal family to be sorta normal, they\u2019ve been through it all. And even after facing tons of unfair scrutiny from the public and press, they only seem stronger\u2014I mean, last winter they legit just came out with a six-part Netflix docuseries that explores the entire span of their \u2019ship.\n\nSo while you\u2019re trying to figure out if you have a shot at running into them in Los Angeles, let\u2019s take a trip down memory lane and see how these two royals fell in love.\n\nOctober 31, 2016\n\nThe Sunday Express reports that Prince Harry has been secretly dating Suits star Meghan Markle. According to one source, Harry is \u201chappier than he\u2019s been for many years\u201d and \u201cthere\u2019s definitely chemistry between them.\u201d\n\n\n\nGetty\n\nNovember 2, 2016\n\nBoth Toronto paper Star and Us Weekly report that Harry and Meghan attended a Halloween party together in Canada following a \u201cbait-and-switch\u201d situation at Heathrow Airport. (Meghan lives in Toronto when Suits is filming.) People, meanwhile, reports that Harry has already introduced his new girlfriend to his father, Prince Charles. According to one source, \u201cHarry is pretty serious about her and she is pretty serious about him.\u201d\n\nMeghan at an E! event in May 2016. Getty\n\nNovember 8, 2016\n\nHarry confirms his relationship by releasing a rare statement that includes a plea to the media and social media trolls to stop the \u201cwave of abuse and harassment.\u201d According to Harry, there have been \u201cnightly legal battles\u201d to stop papers from publishing defamatory stories while Meghan\u2019s mother has been fighting photographers at front door.\n\n\u201cPrince Harry is worried about Ms. Markle\u2019s safety and is deeply disappointed that he has not been able to protect her. It is not right that a few months into a relationship with him that Ms. Markle should be subjected to such a storm. He knows commentators will say this is \u2018the price she has to pay\u2019 and that \u2018this is all part of the game.\u2019 He strongly disagrees. This is not a game\u2014it is her life and his.\u201d\n\nDecember 7, 2016\n\nWhile at a flower shop in Toronto, Meghan is pictured wearing a necklace with the letters \u201cM\u201d and \u201cH.\u201d According to Entertainment Tonight, the 14-karat gold Maya Brenner Asymmetrical Letter necklace is $240, with an additional $60 for each letter.\n\nDecember 14, 2016\n\nMeghan and Harry are spotted holding hands in public for the first time after catching The Curious Incident of the Dog in the Nighttime on London\u2019s West End. The Sun reports that the couple, who wore his-and-hers beanies, admired Christmas lights along Piccadilly. The day before, Meghan and Harry are spotted picking out a six-foot Christmas tree together.\n\nHarry in London, December 2016. Getty\n\nDecember 20, 2016\n\nUs Weekly reports that Queen Elizabeth II is \u201cfully supportive\u201d of Harry\u2019s relationship with Meghan. According to one source, the Queen is \u201cdelighted to see Harry in a loving relationship.\u201d\n\nJanuary 6, 2017\n\nMeghan and Harry embark on their first official vacation together after spending New Year\u2019s in London. Us Weekly reports the couple jetted off to the Norwegian fjords to catch the Northern Lights, staying with Harry\u2019s close friend expedition guide and polar consultant Inge Solheim at his luxury property in Troms\u00f8. According to a source at The Sun, Harry \u201cput a lot of thought into it and wanted to make it as romantic and special as possible.\u201d\n\nFebruary 2, 2017\n\nMeghan and Harry are spotted holding hands in London after dinner at the exclusive Soho House, where they reportedly first met last June through mutual friend Markus Anderson, a consultant at the private members\u2019 club. Sources tell The Sun that the actor, who is currently on a break from filming Suits, has \u201cvirtually moved in\u201d with Harry at his cottage in Kensington Palace. One friend predicts a spring engagement: \u201cI know that sounds a bit crazily soon, but he\u2019s head over heels and they can\u2019t bear to be apart.\u201d\n\nMarch 4, 2017\n\nMeghan joins Harry at a friend\u2019s wedding in Montego Bay, Jamaica. According to People, Meghan wore a long floral dress and sunglasses while Harry served as one of 14 ushers in a navy blue blazer and pants.\n\nGetty\n\nApril 7, 2017\n\nIn an announcement and final post, Meghan\u2019s lifestyle website, The Tig, shuts down after nearly three years. Despite speculations that this is a sign Meghan and Harry will soon tie the knot, a source tells People that the actor\u2019s decision to close the site is related to her filming schedule for Suits and her humanitarian work.\n\nApril 13, 2017\n\nHarry secretly flies to Toronto to spend Easter weekend with Meghan, according to photos obtained by E! News. The site reports that Harry arrived with a large duffel bag and sported a baseball hat to hide his face outside Meghan\u2019s building.\n\nApril 14, 2017\n\nTMZ publishes photos of Meghan wearing a new ring on her left index finger while out in Toronto. The ring contains one important detail: the initial \u201cH.\u201d\n\nMay 7, 2017\n\nMeghan and Harry share their first public kiss following Harry\u2019s participation in the annual Audi Polo Challenge in Ascot, England. The smooch happens outside the polo fields on a parking lot. That same weekend, Meghan is seen cheering on the prince from the sidelines in a stylish navy blue dress and white blazer combo.\n\nDAVID HARTLEY/REX/Shutterstock\n\nDAVID HARTLEY/REX/Shutterstock\n\nMay 20, 2017\n\nMeghan is Harry\u2019s date at Pippa Middleton\u2019s wedding reception, held at the Middletons\u2019 $8 million estate in Bucklebury. According to E! News, Meghan\u2019s absence from the ceremony was per royal protocol to ensure royals like Harry don\u2019t upstage civilian events. Following the ceremony, Harry reportedly drove straight to Kensington Palace, where Meghan had been staying for a few days, to pick up his date. FYI, church door to palace, it\u2019s about a three-hour round-trip drive, so it must be ~love~.\n\nJune 19, 2017\n\nDaily Mail reports that Harry has given Meghan a gold ring\u2014for her thumb. According to one source, Harry gave the ring about six weeks ago and Meghan has \u201chappily\u201d informed people on the set of Suits that it indeed is from the royal and that it\u2019s actually too big for her thumb. The ring is the latest piece of jewelry Harry has given his lady, joining a collection that includes a blue-and-white bracelet (which matches his own), a Cartier Love bracelet, a Maya Brenner necklace with the initials \u201cM\u201d and \u201cH,\u201d and a gold arrow ring.\n\nSeptember 5, 2017\n\nSpeaking to Vanity Fair in a rare interview, Meghan opens up about being \u201creally happy and in love\u201d with Harry. She also confirms that they met in July 2016 and managed to date under the radar for a few months before the press caught on.\n\n\u201cI can tell you that at the end of the day, I think it\u2019s really simple. We\u2019re two people who are really happy and in love. We were very quietly dating for about six months before it became news, and I was working during that whole time, and the only thing that changed was people\u2019s perception. Nothing about me changed. I\u2019m still the same person that I am, and I\u2019ve never defined myself by my relationship.\u201d\n\nIn the same interview, Meghan also says \u201cthere will be a time\u201d when they come forward and share more of their life together with the public, but for now, they want to keep things as private as possible. \u201cThis is for us. It\u2019s part of what makes it so special, that it\u2019s just ours. But we\u2019re happy. Personally, I love a great love story.\u201d\n\nCourtesy of Vanity Fair/Peter Lindbergh\n\nSeptember 24, 2017\n\nMeghan and Harry make their first public appearance together at an official royal event, except for one minor detail: They sit 18 seats apart due to royal protocol.\n\nGetty\n\nSeptember 25, 2017\n\nMeghan and Harry sit together at the Invictus Games.

After changing his diaper, I felt a sharp cramp. I dropped to the floor with him in my arms, humming a lullaby to keep us both calm, the cheerful tune a stark contrast to my sense that something was not right. I knew, as I clutched my firstborn child, that I was losing my second.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe have learned that when people ask how any of us are doing, and when they really listen to the answer, with an open heart and mind, the load of grief often becomes lighter\u2014for all of us,\u201d she continued. \u201cIn being invited to share our pain, together we take the first steps toward healing.\u201d\n\nRead her moving full essay here.\n\nDecember 4, 2020\n\nHarry and Meghan are spotted buying their first California Christmas tree!

We also find out that Meghan was required to give up control of her Instagram account, lifestyle blog, and even her passport (!!) in order to ~officially~ join the royal family, although she says she \u201cnever had to sign anything that restricts me from talking.\u201d Not-ed! When discussing her feelings about the formal exit from the Firm, she also admits that it \u201ctakes a lot of effort to forgive.\u201d *cue le dramatic music here*\n\nShe even recalls teaching her son, Archie, about the polite way to pass salt and pepper shakers across a table\u2014aka by holding them together\u2014which she\u2019d learned from her friend\u2019s mom. \u201cShe said, \u2018You never move one without the other.\u2019 That\u2019s me and Harry.

And perhaps some of those wounds can be healed in the process,\u201d the source adds.\n\nSeptember 19, 2022\n\nMeghan joins Prince Harry and the entire royal family for Queen Elizabeth II\u2019s funeral at Westminster Abbey. Interestingly enough, there is quite a bit of controversy surrounding the seating at the service, as Harry and Meghan do not join William and Kate in the front row. Instead, the Duke and Duchess of Sussex wind up in a corner at the end of the second row beside Princess Beatrice and her husband, Edoardo Mapelli Mozzi.\n\nWPA Pool // Getty Images\n\n^Awk vibes for sure\u2026.\n\nDecember 8, 2022\n\nHarry and Meghan\u2019s highly anticipated Netflix docuseries Harry and Meghan finally (!!) drops its first three episodes.

But that\u2019s not why we\u2019re telling it.

Afterwards, apparently the Duchess of Sussex was the first to message him on Instagram.\n\n\"Eventually, we exchanged phone numbers, and mitigated the conversation over to text, going late into the night,\" Harry dishes in the project, adding that he was \"texting like a teenager\" through the next day.\n\nThe Duke of Sussex also highlights that it was \"uncanny,\" \"surreal,\" and \"bizarre\" that this convo with his now wife began on July 1, 2016\u2014aka what would have been his mother's fifty-fifth birthday. \ud83e\udd7a\u2764\ufe0f\n\nFor a bunch of other revelatory insights from Spare, check out this handy-dandy story:\n\nRelated Story The Biggest Revelations From Prince Harry\u2019s Memoir\n\nMarch 1, 2023\n\nAccording to multiple reports, Harry and Meghan are asked to leave their Frogmore Cottage home in England.

Oh, and apparently Tyler Perry pulls out all the stops for the royal baby's big day, flying in 10-person Gospel choir to sing \"Oh Happy Day\" and \"This Little Light of Mine\" at the event.\n\nOh, and before you ask\u2014yes, King Charles, Queen Camilla, Prince William and Kate Middleton were all invited. But, no, they were not in attendance. Whomp!\n\nMay 16, 2023\n\nHarry and Meghan face a \"near catastrophic car chase\" involving paparazzi in New York City, according to the Sussexes' spokesperson.

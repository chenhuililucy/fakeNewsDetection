Jumanji co-stars Kevin Hart and Dwayne Johnson have led a star-stuffed challenge to give to the Red Cross. (Hart is at $50K.) Jennifer Lopez and Alex Rodriguez each donated $25,000.", "images": ["https://www.usatoday.com/gcdn/-mm-/660ea1e0bd7e6049e3ea4dba28cac038717f1f2b/c=67-18-565-516/local/-/media/2019/03/13/USATODAY/USATODAY/636880824691829556-bryan-alexander.jpg?width=48&height=48&fit=crop&format=pjpg&auto=webp", "https://www.usatoday.com/gcdn/-mm-/d5b99f3ad23e56fc75759fd4ae2cd796bd93e213/c=0-178-3500-2155/local/-/media/2017/08/29/USATODAY/USATODAY/636396358863124149-AP-PEOPLE-SANDRA-BULLOCK-88789300.JPG?width=3200&height=1808&fit=crop&format=pjpg&auto=webp", "https://www.usatoday.com/gcdn/-mm-/d5b99f3ad23e56fc75759fd4ae2cd796bd93e213/c=0-178-3500-2155/local/-/media/2017/08/29/USATODAY/USATODAY/636396358863124149-AP-PEOPLE-SANDRA-BULLOCK-88789300.JPG?width=660&height=373&fit=crop&format=pjpg&auto=webp"], "top_img": "https://www.usatoday.com/gcdn/-mm-/d5b99f3ad23e56fc75759fd4ae2cd796bd93e213/c=0-178-3500-2155/local/-/media/2017/08/29/USATODAY/USATODAY/636396358863124149-AP-PEOPLE-SANDRA-BULLOCK-88789300.JPG?width=3200&height=1808&fit=crop&format=pjpg&auto=webp", "keywords": [], "authors": [], "canonical_link": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/life/people/2017/08/29/sandra-bullock-donates-1-million-harvey-red-cross-relief/614894001/", "title": "Sandra Bullock donates $1 million to Harvey Red Cross relief", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1,minimum-scale=1", "theme-color": "#0098FE", "og": {"title": "Sandra Bullock donates $1 million to Harvey Red Cross relief", "description": "The actress, who has a home in Texas, gives the Red Cross a needed $1 million check saying, \u201cWe all have to do our part.\u201d", "url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/life/people/2017/08/29/sandra-bullock-donates-1-million-harvey-red-cross-relief/614894001/", "site_name": "USA TODAY", "image": {"identifier": "https://www.usatoday.com/gcdn/-mm-/d5b99f3ad23e56fc75759fd4ae2cd796bd93e213/c=0-178-3500-2155/local/-/media/2017/08/29/USATODAY/USATODAY/636396358863124149-AP-PEOPLE-SANDRA-BULLOCK-88789300.JPG?width=3200&height=1808&fit=crop&format=pjpg&auto=webp", "width": 3200, "height": 1808}, "type": "article"}, "article": {"author": "Bryan Alexander", "content_tier": "free", "opinion": "false"}, "description": "The actress, who has a home in Texas, gives the Red Cross a needed $1 million check saying, \u201cWe all have to do our part.\u201d", "fb": {"pages": "13652355666,48958576760,156345381090801,110471702456365,6566864515,137698179626815,315942225236045,927427260614748,183850168300771,1443524575938047,251228454889939,158095147555989,115535341805950,236655713446291,1621466394844549,250325640686,177037772444433,1972936962947967,2047091012096533,535551216797440", "app_id": 215046668549694}, "ROBOTS": "NOODP, NOYDIR, max-image-preview:large", "google": "notranslate", "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "image": "https://www.usatoday.com/gcdn/-mm-/d5b99f3ad23e56fc75759fd4ae2cd796bd93e213/c=0-178-3500-2155/local/-/media/2017/08/29/USATODAY/USATODAY/636396358863124149-AP-PEOPLE-SANDRA-BULLOCK-88789300.JPG?width=1600&height=800&fit=crop&format=pjpg&auto=webp", "site": "@usatoday", "creator": "@usatoday", "title": "Sandra Bullock donates $1 million to Harvey Red Cross relief", "description": "The actress, who has a home in Texas, gives the Red Cross a needed $1 million check saying, \u201cWe all have to do our part.\u201d"}}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1503936000.0, "source": "https://www.usatoday.com", "summary": ""}

Additional performers will be announced at a later date.\n\n\"Given the devastation of Hurricanes Harvey, Irma and Maria and the mass shootings in Las Vegas, we feel a commitment to our fans to address all of the tragedies not in one somber and solemn moment or segment, but rather devote the entire evening to uplifting the fans through high-spirited music,\" said Frank Tanki, General Manager of CMT and TV Land. \"The special has always been a place where artists from different genres can stand side-by-side, and now more than ever, we want to showcase the power of unity and resilience through music.\"", "images": ["https://images.paramount.tech/uri/mgid:arc:imageassetref:cmt.com:f0441762-0952-45a8-b253-7a6fad0d802f?quality=0.7&gen=ntrn&legacyStatusCode=true", "https://images.paramount.tech/uri/mgid:arc:imageassetref:cmt.com:3cdef211-7973-46c0-8828-076bea8e6db5?quality=0.7&gen=ntrn&legacyStatusCode=true&format=webp&height=180&width=320&crop=true", "https://images.paramount.tech/uri/mgid:arc:imageassetref:cmt.com:3cdef211-7973-46c0-8828-076bea8e6db5?quality=0.7&gen=ntrn&legacyStatusCode=true&format=jpg&width=1200&height=630&crop=true", "https://images.paramount.tech/uri/mgid:arc:imageassetref:cmt.com:7455ec8c-7aca-4a9f-a985-c40108297ce3?quality=0.7&gen=ntrn&legacyStatusCode=true", "https://images.paramount.tech/uri/mgid:arc:imageassetref:cmt.com:09670650-2d1e-4548-84f0-15e6df9bf043?quality=0.7&gen=ntrn&legacyStatusCode=true"], "top_img": "https://images.paramount.tech/uri/mgid:arc:imageassetref:cmt.com:3cdef211-7973-46c0-8828-076bea8e6db5?quality=0.7&gen=ntrn&legacyStatusCode=true&format=jpg&width=1200&height=630&crop=true", "keywords": [], "authors": [], "canonical_link": "https://www.cmt.com/news/5grqu1/2017-cmt-artists-of-the-year-will-be-a-night-of-hope-and-healing", "title": "2017 CMT Artists of the Year Will Be a Night of Hope and Healing", "meta_data": {"app_version": "626273fa4-2843-2023-10-18", "robots": "noydir,noodp, max-image-preview:large", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=1, maximum-scale=2", "theme-color": "#87b6c0", "msapplication-config": "/browserconfig.xml", "description": "Adds Collaborations by Andra Day, Little Big Town, Lee Ann Womack and Common", "original-source": "https://www.cmt.com/news/5grqu1/2017-cmt-artists-of-the-year-will-be-a-night-of-hope-and-healing", "search": {"title": "2017 CMT Artists of the Year Will Be a Night of Hope and Healing", "description": "Adds Collaborations by Andra Day, Little Big Town, Lee Ann Womack and Common", "imageUrl": "https://images.paramount.tech/uri/mgid:arc:imageassetref:cmt.com:3cdef211-7973-46c0-8828-076bea8e6db5?quality=0.7&gen=ntrn&legacyStatusCode=true", "imageHeight": 574, "imageWidth": 1020, "url": "/news/5grqu1/2017-cmt-artists-of-the-year-will-be-a-night-of-hope-and-healing", "contentType": "Article", "bucketName": "Article", "labelName": "News", "contentDate": "2017-10-12T14:16:20.000Z"}, "news_keywords": "CMT Artists of the Year", "og": {"title": "2017 CMT Artists of the Year Will Be a Night of Hope and Healing", "description": "The 2017 CMT Artists of the Year has been transformed into a night of hope and healing following the devastating hurricanes and the deadly mass shooting at the Route 91 Harvest music festival in Las Vegas.", "image": {"identifier": "https://images.paramount.tech/uri/mgid:arc:imageassetref:cmt.com:3cdef211-7973-46c0-8828-076bea8e6db5?quality=0.7&gen=ntrn&legacyStatusCode=true&format=jpg&width=1200&height=630&crop=true", "width": 1200, "height": 630}, "url": "https://www.cmt.com/news/5grqu1/2017-cmt-artists-of-the-year-will-be-a-night-of-hope-and-healing", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "description": "The 2017 CMT Artists of the Year has been transformed into a night of hope and healing following the devastating hurricanes and the deadly mass shooting at the Route 91 Harvest music festival in Las Vegas.", "title": "2017 CMT Artists of the Year Will Be a Night of Hope and Healing", "image": "https://images.paramount.tech/uri/mgid:arc:imageassetref:cmt.com:3cdef211-7973-46c0-8828-076bea8e6db5?quality=0.7&gen=ntrn&legacyStatusCode=true&format=jpg&width=1200&height=630&crop=true"}}, "movies": [], "publish_date": null, "source": "http://www.cmt.com", "summary": ""}

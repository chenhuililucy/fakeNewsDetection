Matthew Perry visited \"Watch What Happens Live with Andy Cohen\" on Thursday where a fan called in and asked the actor about his \"Friends\" residual checks.\n\n\"I get a little something and I go, 'Hey, that's nice!'\" Perry said elusively. \"It's a really great job I had I started the job when I was 24. It was amazing. I had the job from 24 to 34, I'll never have a job like that ever again.\"\n\nWATCH: Lisa Kudrow Talks Awful 'Friends' Guest Star Who Body Shamed Her: 'Now You're F**kable'\n\n\n\nThe \"Friends\" talk continued when Perry played \"Plead the Fifth.\" Right out of the gate, the actor, who played Chandler Bing on the show, pleaded the Fifth when asked to play \"Shag, Marry, Kill\" with his three female \"Friends\" co-stars.\n\nHost Cohen then asked Perry about David Schwimmer's claim that some of the co-stars broke the show's rumored \"sex contract.\"\n\n\"I don't know who he was referring to,\" Perry insisted. \"I think there was no sex between them, unless I was really missing something.\"\n\nPerry also revealed that there was one \"Friends\" storyline that he specifically axed.\n\nWATCH: Jennifer Aniston Reveals Why She Thinks 'Friends' Would Never Exist in Today's Smartphone Age\n\n\n\n\"There was a storyline on \"Friends\" where Chandler went to a male strip joint because he really liked the sandwiches, and I called up and said, 'Let's not do this one,'\" he noted.", "images":

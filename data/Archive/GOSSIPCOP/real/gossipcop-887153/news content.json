Good Friday, where do you want me to start?\u201d Goldry exclaimed. \u201cWomen being harassed is Hollywood. Everything old is new again. Producers are abusing starlets. There\u2019s Nazis marching in the street. And suddenly nude pantyhose are on-trend. I have never felt more at home.\u201d\n\nLater, Goldry called out Weinstein directly: \u201cI actually did have one meeting with Harvey. I was invited to his hotel room. When I arrived, he was naked hanging upside down from a monkey bar. Tried to trick me into thinking his genitals were actually his face. It almost worked. The resemblance is uncanny.\u201d\n\nRELATED:Kate McKinnon's Kellyanne Conway Is \u2018It\u2019 \u2013 and not in a good way\n\nMcKinnon\u2019s Goldry wasn\u2019t the only one with extraneous jokes about Weinstein\u2019s appearance. \"Weekend Update\" star Michael Che also cracked, \u201cIt\u2019s so hard to make jokes about sexual assault, but so easy to make jokes about a guy who looks like this. I mean, he looks like chewed-up bubblegum rolled in cat hair.\u201d\n\nFor his part, Che\u2019s co-anchor Colin Jost remained on-topic: \u201cHe needs a specialized facility where there are no women, no contact with the outside world, metal bars \u2013 and it\u2019s a prison.\u201d", "images": ["https://www.usatoday.com/gcdn/-mm-/5be533b042ff583fa288d340d7cea9a86748e7ab/c=0-0-2999-1694/local/-/media/2017/10/15/USATODAY/USATODAY/636436508139688551-NUP-180310-0038.JPG?width=2999&height=1694&fit=crop&format=pjpg&auto=webp"], "top_img": "https://www.usatoday.com/gcdn/-mm-/5be533b042ff583fa288d340d7cea9a86748e7ab/c=0-0-2999-1694/local/-/media/2017/10/15/USATODAY/USATODAY/636436508139688551-NUP-180310-0038.JPG?width=2999&height=1694&fit=crop&format=pjpg&auto=webp", "keywords": [], "authors": [], "canonical_link": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/life/entertainthis/2017/10/15/saturday-night-live-finally-tackles-harvey-weinstein-scandal-harassment-hollywood/759900001/", "title": "'Saturday Night Live' finally tackles the Harvey Weinstein scandal, harassment in Hollywood", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1,minimum-scale=1", "theme-color": "#0098FE", "og": {"title": "'Saturday Night Live' finally tackles the Harvey Weinstein scandal, harassment in Hollywood", "description": "After receiving criticism for skirting the controversy, the sketch comedy show finally addressed the Weinstein scandal as well as Hollywood's toxic masculinity problem.", "url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/life/entertainthis/2017/10/15/saturday-night-live-finally-tackles-harvey-weinstein-scandal-harassment-hollywood/759900001/", "site_name": "USA TODAY", "image": {"identifier": "https://www.usatoday.com/gcdn/-mm-/5be533b042ff583fa288d340d7cea9a86748e7ab/c=0-0-2999-1694/local/-/media/2017/10/15/USATODAY/USATODAY/636436508139688551-NUP-180310-0038.JPG?width=2999&height=1694&fit=crop&format=pjpg&auto=webp", "width": 2999, "height": 1694}, "type": "article"}, "article": {"author": "Jaleesa Jones", "content_tier": "free", "opinion": "false"}, "description": "After receiving criticism for skirting the controversy, the sketch comedy show finally addressed the Weinstein scandal as well as Hollywood's toxic masculinity problem.", "fb": {"pages": "13652355666,48958576760,156345381090801,110471702456365,6566864515,137698179626815,315942225236045,927427260614748,183850168300771,1443524575938047,251228454889939,158095147555989,115535341805950,236655713446291,1621466394844549,250325640686,177037772444433,1972936962947967,2047091012096533,535551216797440", "app_id": 215046668549694}, "ROBOTS": "NOODP, NOYDIR, max-image-preview:large", "google": "notranslate", "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "image": "https://www.usatoday.com/gcdn/-mm-/5be533b042ff583fa288d340d7cea9a86748e7ab/c=0-0-2999-1694/local/-/media/2017/10/15/USATODAY/USATODAY/636436508139688551-NUP-180310-0038.JPG?width=1600&height=800&fit=crop&format=pjpg&auto=webp", "site": "@usatoday", "creator": "@usatoday", "title": "'Saturday Night Live' finally tackles the Harvey Weinstein scandal, harassment in Hollywood", "description": "After receiving criticism for skirting the controversy, the sketch comedy show finally addressed the Weinstein scandal as well as Hollywood's toxic masculinity problem."}}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1507996800.0, "source": "https://www.usatoday.com", "summary": ""}

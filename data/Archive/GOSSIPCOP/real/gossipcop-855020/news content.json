Lopes passed away at the age of 30 during a car crash in Honduras.\n\n\"You have like a weird death here coming through,\" Henry tells Watkins at the start of their reading. \"She'll like joke, this is weird, she's doing this weird hand thing with me, she's just being silly. She's very, very direct. Someone might go by the nickname I've never heard before, a really unique one. I don't know this one.\"\n\nWhile Henry may not know who he's talking about, Watkins and a trio of witnesses watching the reading on a monitor are instantly certain it's Lopes.\n\n\"There is a reference to South America. She's referencing to a car accident,\" he continues, shocking the singer. \"She's placing these two together, but she's having me acknowledge that if this had happened in another country, this wouldn't have happened. I wouldn't think it would happen to me in the states. If someone is not familiar with the way that we drive in a different country and as a result we die, when had we been on the road and perfectly capable, we might have been able to manage in the United States.\"\n\nT-Boz understood what he was telling her, explaining that \"it's the way that the roads are\" in Honduras that caused the crash.\n\n\"She's just, from her perspective, happy that no was else was killed in this incident,\" Henry relays. \"She's more focused on others, their well being.\"\n\nThere were eight other people in the vehicle with Lopes, who was the only one in the accident who died.", "images": ["https://images.toofab.com/image/b3/2by3/2023/10/10/b3f51707284d4d54b3b61313061f5e8f_xs.jpg",

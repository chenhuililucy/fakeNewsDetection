Us Weekly reports Portwood gave birth to little James in the early hours of Tuesday morning, and he weighed 7 pounds, 11 ounces.\n\nPortwood and Glennon met while filming Marriage Boot Camp with her then-fianc\u00e9, Matt Baier, and their relationship hit a snag back in September when she discovered two of Glennon\u2019s exes served him with restraining orders. But by November, Portwood announced her pregnancy by writing a message in the sand. \u201cI\u2019m very excited for my future with Andrew and our little family we are starting together,\u201d she wrote on Instagram.\n\n\u201cWhen I first found out [about the pregnancy], I was a little scared,\u201dshe told Us Weekly. \u201cI just kind of sat down and thought about it and realized that it was a big step in my life and it was a good thing actually, and I was really happy within 30 minutes.\u201d\n\nMore From Cosmopolitan\n\nPeople reports that Portwood was concerned about being pregnant because of her history with mental health issues; she started taking antidepressants while seven months pregnant, under her doctor\u2019s supervision.\n\n\u201cI had a concern with my depression when I went in and talked to my doctor, and it was a concern that postpartum [depression] was something that could happen because of how I\u2019m doing right now,\u201d she told the magazine. \u201cIt\u2019s just something you have to do to make yourself feel better, and you have to make sure it\u2019s safe for the baby and just move forward from that.\u201d\n\nJames is Portwood\u2019s second child; she has a 9-year-old, Leah, with her ex-fianc\u00e9, Gary Shirley. Portwood recently shared a photo of Leah practicing for her new role as big sister with a baby doll in her arms.", "images":

Ahead, a look at their shared work.\n\n01 of 06 Take Me Home Tonight (2011) Everett Collection Chris Pratt and Anna Faris met on the set of this comedy way back in 2007. (Faris was still married at the time, and the future didn't get together until after her divorce.) It took another four years, however, for the movie to arrive in theaters. In Take Me Home Tonight, which also stars Topher Grace and Teresa Palmer, Pratt and Faris play a longterm couple who split up in the film's final act.\n\n02 of 06 What's Your Number? (2011) Twentieth Century Fox This underrated romantic comedy starred Faris and Marvel favorite Chris Evans as its leads -- and also featured Pratt in a supporting role as one of Faris' characters ex-boyfriends, a man nicknamed \"Disgusting Donald.\"\n\n03 of 06 Top Chef (2012) David Moir/Bravo/Getty Images During a 2012 episode of Top Chef, the competitors were tasked with catering a homecoming party for Pratt and Faris. \"Pack as many calories you can into each bite, and I think you're going to win our heart,\" Pratt said. Added Faris: \"We are really adventurous eaters.\"\n\n04 of 06 Movie 43 (2013) EVERETT COLLECTION Derided as one of the worst movies released in the last decade (the film sports a 4 percent rating on Rotten Tomatoes), Movie 43 is an R-rated anthology comedy that features a segment where Pratt's character is on the cusp of proposing to Faris' character ... only to find out she harbors a scatological secret.\n\n05 of 06 Saturday Night Live (2014) Dana Edelson/NBC/Getty Images Fresh off his breakout success in Guardians of the Galaxy, Pratt hosted the season 40 premiere of SNL in September of 2014. During his monologue, Pratt called out Faris as \"that hottie in the audience right there\" while playing an acoustic guitar. (Faris, as Pratt noted, had hosted SNL twice prior.)", "images": ["https://ew.com/thmb/uCgDZwwrdMLG8pwcLm2Nj5MiIh4=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/mcdtame_ec030_h-2000-74b66b302d174bd9b0b70f66df28372b.jpg", "https://ew.com/thmb/bGRItNuICD6j4tDD01KZ0j0gpAk=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/whats-your-number-2000-d2c4fb0c64a34a9cb1ff1d8edd1ed494.jpg", "https://ew.com/thmb/zEFsN8qIpNIo4Biz2i8SvWfExxY=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/gettyimages-456266648-2000-71c1dcfed00747a38f233eee9e99a116.jpg", "https://ew.com/thmb/0dhYgNrAMozXFfMKpkvkdGQ4Fn0=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/mcdmofo_ec054_h-1-2000-88d6373600ae4d0f8f233081d69d7081.jpg", "https://ew.com/thmb/fDOGWAc_FW8Xs7rWflExl_kPzvg=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/mcdtame_ec031_h-2000-3272acef022e49c89aecd358a34ae70d.jpg", "https://ew.com/thmb/U3jNyE5st9ZhJdy5FAIjp6JKiC4=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/gettyimages-157920163-2000-27465d5a085a49a7b46a82321892541a.jpg", "https://ew.com/thmb/WlBpcMqvY4kdKtRKVjdQm_G5rYc=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/109289_0338b-2000-d69107bc91024f4d89baa70a430c5680.jpg"], "top_img": "https://ew.com/thmb/fDOGWAc_FW8Xs7rWflExl_kPzvg=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/mcdtame_ec031_h-2000-3272acef022e49c89aecd358a34ae70d.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": [], "canonical_link": "https://ew.com/news/chris-pratt-anna-faris-movie-tv-roles/", "title": "Chris Pratt and Anna Faris' Memorable Onscreen Pairings", "meta_data": {"robots": "max-image-preview:large, NOODP, NOYDIR", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "description": "After their separation, look back at the couple's onscreen work", "parsely-section": "News", "parsely-tags": "News,Movies,TV", "article": {"section": "EW", "author": "https://www.facebook.com/entertainmentweekly"}, "fb": {"app_id": 2485718348341688}, "og": {"type": "article", "site_name": "EW.com", "url": "https://ew.com/news/chris-pratt-anna-faris-movie-tv-roles/", "title": "Chris Pratt and Anna Faris' Memorable Onscreen Pairings", "description": "After their separation, look back at the couple's onscreen work", "image": "https://ew.com/thmb/fDOGWAc_FW8Xs7rWflExl_kPzvg=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/mcdtame_ec031_h-2000-3272acef022e49c89aecd358a34ae70d.jpg"}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "site": "@EW", "title": "Chris Pratt and Anna Faris' Memorable Onscreen Pairings", "description": "After their separation, look back at the couple's onscreen work", "image": "https://ew.com/thmb/fDOGWAc_FW8Xs7rWflExl_kPzvg=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/mcdtame_ec031_h-2000-3272acef022e49c89aecd358a34ae70d.jpg"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#F4F4F4", "msapplication-TileImage": "/static/1.5.1/icons/favicons/mstile-144x144.png", "msapplication-square70x70logo": "/static/1.5.1/icons/favicons/mstile-70x70.png", "msapplication-square150x150logo": "/static/1.5.1/icons/favicons/mstile-150x150.png", "msapplication-square310x310logo": "/static/1.5.1/icons/favicons/mstile-310x310.png", "msapplication-wide310x150logo": "/static/1.5.1/icons/favicons/mstile-310x150.png"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": null, "source": "https://ew.com", "summary": ""}

It was rough.\"\n\n\"And it's a reminder that at the end of our lives, whatever else we've accomplished, the thing that we'll remember are the joys that our children, and hopefully way later, our grandchildren bring.\"\n\nMalia was spotted on the Cambridge, Mass., campus in August moving in for her first year at the Ivy League school after spending a gap year traveling and interning at the Weinstein film company. Barack and Michelle, both Harvard Law graduates, were on-hand to help their oldest daughter with the move.\n\nWhile Malia takes on Harvard, the Obama family continues to live in Washington, D.C. while their younger daughter, Sasha, 16, finishes high school.", "images": ["https://www.usatoday.com/gcdn/-mm-/6a87dfd0cf9ee24b01d8d8a723b1b9c0a66de07a/c=0-46-3026-1756/local/-/media/2017/09/27/USATODAY/USATODAY/636421012848622668-AP-OBAMA-MALIAS-GRADUATION-82502200.JPG?width=3026&height=1710&fit=crop&format=pjpg&auto=webp"], "top_img": "https://www.usatoday.com/gcdn/-mm-/6a87dfd0cf9ee24b01d8d8a723b1b9c0a66de07a/c=0-46-3026-1756/local/-/media/2017/09/27/USATODAY/USATODAY/636421012848622668-AP-OBAMA-MALIAS-GRADUATION-82502200.JPG?width=3026&height=1710&fit=crop&format=pjpg&auto=webp", "keywords": [], "authors": [], "canonical_link": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/life/people/2017/09/27/president-obama-cried-while-dropping-off-malia-harvard-like-open-heart-surgery/707475001/", "title": "President Obama cried while dropping off Malia at Harvard: 'Like open-heart surgery'", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1,minimum-scale=1", "theme-color": "#0098FE", "og": {"title": "President Obama cried while dropping off Malia at Harvard: 'Like open-heart surgery'", "description": "Former President Obama described dropping off his oldest daughter Malia, 19, on Harvard University's campus last month for\u00a0her freshman year.", "url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/life/people/2017/09/27/president-obama-cried-while-dropping-off-malia-harvard-like-open-heart-surgery/707475001/", "site_name": "USA TODAY", "image": {"identifier": "https://www.usatoday.com/gcdn/-mm-/6a87dfd0cf9ee24b01d8d8a723b1b9c0a66de07a/c=0-46-3026-1756/local/-/media/2017/09/27/USATODAY/USATODAY/636421012848622668-AP-OBAMA-MALIAS-GRADUATION-82502200.JPG?width=3026&height=1710&fit=crop&format=pjpg&auto=webp", "width": 3026, "height": 1710}, "type": "article"}, "article": {"author": "Maeve McDermott", "content_tier": "free", "opinion": "false"}, "description": "Former President Obama described dropping off his oldest daughter Malia, 19, on Harvard University's campus last month for\u00a0her freshman year.", "fb": {"pages": "13652355666,48958576760,156345381090801,110471702456365,6566864515,137698179626815,315942225236045,927427260614748,183850168300771,1443524575938047,251228454889939,158095147555989,115535341805950,236655713446291,1621466394844549,250325640686,177037772444433,1972936962947967,2047091012096533,535551216797440", "app_id": 215046668549694}, "ROBOTS": "NOODP, NOYDIR, max-image-preview:large", "google": "notranslate", "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "image": "https://www.usatoday.com/gcdn/-mm-/6a87dfd0cf9ee24b01d8d8a723b1b9c0a66de07a/c=0-46-3026-1756/local/-/media/2017/09/27/USATODAY/USATODAY/636421012848622668-AP-OBAMA-MALIAS-GRADUATION-82502200.JPG?width=1600&height=800&fit=crop&format=pjpg&auto=webp", "site": "@usatoday", "creator": "@usatoday", "title": "President Obama cried while dropping off Malia at Harvard: 'Like open-heart surgery'", "description": "Former President Obama described dropping off his oldest daughter Malia, 19, on Harvard University's campus last month for\u00a0her freshman year."}}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1506441600.0, "source": "https://www.usatoday.com", "summary": ""}

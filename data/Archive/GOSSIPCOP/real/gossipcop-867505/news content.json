Just ask Billy Crystal.\n\nThe legendary comedian, 69, recently tore a rib muscle from sneezing.\n\n\u201cSo I\u2019m in that position that a lot of you young people find your parents in around 8:30,\u201d Crystal told Jimmy Kimmel on Monday. \u201cI\u2019m in a position, like, only a Cirque du Soleil person or a jellyfish could be in. And out of the blue I sneezed, but a violent sneeze.\u201d\n\nHe went on to describe the scenario as if he were an animated figure. \u201cFolks, if it were a cartoon my arms are flying off my body, my eyes are coming out of my head, people in the room are now naked because I blew their clothes off,\u201d Crystal quipped.\n\nSoon after, he began to feel pain.\n\n\u201cI literally could not breathe,\u201d he described. \u201cAnd it\u2019s not an injury you want to brag about. I didn\u2019t rescue a woman out of a burning car. I didn\u2019t catch an orphan falling out of a burning orphanage \u2026 I sneezed.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe have several muscles, which help the ribs move and help us breathe, namely internal intercostal muscles, external intercostal muscles, subcostalis muscle and the transverse thoracis muscle,\u201d Jyoti Kini MD, primary care doctor at Medical Offices of Manhattan tells Page Six. \u201cThese muscles contract during sneezing and even coughing. Sudden violent movements or contractions of these muscles as seen with repeated sneezing can cause injury to these muscles\u2026Treatment of these rib muscle sprains involves rest, ice and anti-inflammatory medications. If caused by sneezing anti-histamines might be helpful.\u201d", "images": ["https://nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2019/09/p6podcast402x.png", "https://decider.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Jada-Pinkett-Smith-on-Today-With-HOda-Jenna.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&w=322&h=215&crop=1", "https://pagesix.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2023/10/NYPICHPDPICT000061771507.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&w=87", "https://pagesix.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2023/10/brit.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&w=87", "https://pagesix.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2023/10/NYPICHPDPICT000061709727.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&w=260&h=174&crop=1", "https://googleads.g.doubleclick.net/pagead/viewthroughconversion/988380111/?value=0&guid=ON&script=0", "https://pagesix.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2023/10/taylor-luggage-1.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&w=87", "https://pagesix.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2023/10/NYPICHPDPICT000061745205-1.jpg?w=93&h=62&crop=1", "https://nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2019/09/apple-podcast-badge402x.png", "https://pagesix.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2023/10/britney-spears-shaved-head.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&w=87", "https://pagesix.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2023/10/NYPICHPDPICT000061779933.jpg?w=93&h=62&crop=1", "https://nypost.com/wp-content/mu-plugins/vip-helpers/images/vip-powered-dark-small.png", "https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6390601&c3=PAGESIX&cj=1&cv=3.6", "https://pagesix.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2023/10/NYPICHPDPICT000061747210.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&w=93&h=62&crop=1", "https://pagesix.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2023/10/bush3.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&w=87", "https://pagesix.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2017/07/gettyimages-632360178.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&w=744", "https://pagesix.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2023/10/NYPICHPDPICT000061709727.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&w=87", "https://pagesix.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2023/10/NYPICHPDPICT000061764880.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&w=260&h=174&crop=1", "https://pagesix.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2023/10/NYPICHPDPICT000061710564.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&w=93&h=62&crop=1", "https://pagesix.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2023/10/EXCL-Sophia-Bush-Ashlyn-Harris-seen-on-cozy-double-date-with-Stacy-London-girlfriend-weeks-before-relationship-news.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&w=260&h=174&crop=1", "https://pagesix.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2023/10/EXCL-Sophia-Bush-Ashlyn-Harris-seen-on-cozy-double-date-with-Stacy-London-girlfriend-weeks-before-relationship-news.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&w=87", "https://pagesix.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2023/10/NYPICHPDPICT000061755715.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&w=93&h=62&crop=1", "https://pagesix.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2023/10/bush3.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&w=260&h=174&crop=1", "https://pagesix.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2023/10/NYPICHPDPICT000061445330.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&w=93&h=62&crop=1", "https://pagesix.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2023/10/NYPICHPDPICT000061745692.jpg?w=93&h=62&crop=1", "https://pagesix.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2023/10/NYPICHPDPICT000061764880.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&w=87", "https://pagesix.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2017/07/gettyimages-632360178.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&w=1024", "https://pagesix.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2023/10/NYPICHPDPICT000061762786.png?w=93&h=62&crop=1"], "top_img": "https://pagesix.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2017/07/gettyimages-632360178.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&w=1024", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Social Links For Derrick Bryson Taylor"], "canonical_link": "https://pagesix.com/2017/07/18/bill-crystal-tore-a-rib-muscle-from-sneezing/", "title": "Billy Crystal tore a rib muscle from sneezing", "meta_data": {"copyright": "Copyright 2023 NYP Holdings.

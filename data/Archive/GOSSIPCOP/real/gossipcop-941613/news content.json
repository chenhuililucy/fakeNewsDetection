The two co-founded the handbag and fashion label Kate Spade New York and share one child, Frances Beatrix Spade, 13.\n\nSpade told \"GMA\" anchor Robin Roberts that his family was doing \u201cas good as we can.\"\n\n\"It\u2019s been very tough, obviously,\" he added. \"She really made an impact.\u201d\n\nThe actor/comedian, on-hand to promote his audio book \"A Polaroid Guy in a Snapchat World\" and his movie \"Father of the Year\" dropping on Netflix July 20, recalled how a run-in with Kate would motivate his companions to dress to the nines.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s funny \u2018cause every girl I was with, or anyone that knew they would see Katie, would dress differently. They would bring their A-game,\" he said. \"It was very sweet.\n\n\"They would be like, \u2018Is Katie coming? Are Andy and Katie gonna be there?\u2019\" he continued. \"And if they were, it was a whole new wardrobe.\"\n\nSpade said Kate, being \"very sweet\" and knowing his friends had dressed to impress, would compliment them.\n\n\"And when I\u2019d say, \u2018You don\u2019t dress up for me,\u2019 they\u2019d go, \u2018Yeah, that\u2019s her and you\u2019re you,'\" joked Spade.\n\nNoting he could just \"start bawling,\" Spade said of his sister-in-law: \u201cShe was such a beautiful, lovely, great spirit that obviously will be missed.\u201d\n\nKate was found dead in her New York City apartment last month of an apparent suicide, Det. Sophia Mason, a spokeswoman for the NYPD, confirmed to USA TODAY. She was 55. The designer was also the aunt of actress Rachel Brosnahan, who stars in Amazon's \"The Marvelous Mrs. Maisel.\"\n\nKate was laid to rest in her hometown of Kansas City on June 21.\n\nContributing: Cara Kelly and Maria Puente\n\nIf you or someone you know may be struggling with suicidal thoughts you can call the U.S. National Suicide Prevention Lifeline at 800-273-TALK (8255) any time of day or night or chat online.\n\nMore:Bryce Dallas Howard, first face of Kate Spade says, 'There's nothing more tragic'\n\nMore:Six things you didn't know about Kate Spade", "images": ["https://www.usatoday.com/gcdn/-mm-/3405f8c580af50b3d94837ac3ee617850b2211e4/c=0-235-3696-2323/local/-/media/2018/07/18/USATODAY/USATODAY/636675079455669859-AFP-AFP-1498D7-99386989.JPG?width=3200&height=1808&fit=crop&format=pjpg&auto=webp", "https://www.usatoday.com/gcdn/presto/2022/01/10/USAT/80977e04-47f0-4613-93aa-d8b5b19cfbef-erin-jensen.jpg?crop=1368,1368,x637,y86&width=48&height=48&format=pjpg&auto=webp", "https://www.usatoday.com/gcdn/-mm-/c95ca5487db02e99caa9618ab3f12daec74da19f/c=87-0-3624-4716/local/-/media/2018/07/18/USATODAY/USATODAY/636675079455669859-AFP-AFP-1498D7-99386989.JPG?width=300&height=400&fit=crop&format=pjpg&auto=webp"], "top_img": "https://www.usatoday.com/gcdn/-mm-/3405f8c580af50b3d94837ac3ee617850b2211e4/c=0-235-3696-2323/local/-/media/2018/07/18/USATODAY/USATODAY/636675079455669859-AFP-AFP-1498D7-99386989.JPG?width=3200&height=1808&fit=crop&format=pjpg&auto=webp", "keywords": [], "authors": [], "canonical_link": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/life/people/2018/07/18/david-spade-kate-spade-death-gma-good-morning-america/795462002/", "title": "David Spade: Family is doing 'as good as we can' after sister-in-law Kate Spade's death", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1,minimum-scale=1", "theme-color": "#0098FE", "og": {"title": "David Spade: Family is doing 'as good as we can' after sister-in-law Kate Spade's death", "description": "David Spade gave an update as to how he and his family are coping following fashion designer Kate Spade's suicide on \"Good Morning America\" Wednesday.", "url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/life/people/2018/07/18/david-spade-kate-spade-death-gma-good-morning-america/795462002/", "site_name": "USA TODAY", "image": {"identifier": "https://www.usatoday.com/gcdn/-mm-/3405f8c580af50b3d94837ac3ee617850b2211e4/c=0-235-3696-2323/local/-/media/2018/07/18/USATODAY/USATODAY/636675079455669859-AFP-AFP-1498D7-99386989.JPG?width=3200&height=1808&fit=crop&format=pjpg&auto=webp", "width": 3200, "height": 1808}, "type": "article"}, "article": {"author": "Erin Jensen", "content_tier": "free", "opinion": "false"}, "description": "David Spade gave an update as to how he and his family are coping following fashion designer Kate Spade's suicide on \"Good Morning America\" Wednesday.", "fb": {"pages": "13652355666,48958576760,156345381090801,110471702456365,6566864515,137698179626815,315942225236045,927427260614748,183850168300771,1443524575938047,251228454889939,158095147555989,115535341805950,236655713446291,1621466394844549,250325640686,177037772444433,1972936962947967,2047091012096533,535551216797440", "app_id": 215046668549694}, "ROBOTS": "NOODP, NOYDIR, max-image-preview:large", "google": "notranslate", "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "image": "https://www.usatoday.com/gcdn/-mm-/3405f8c580af50b3d94837ac3ee617850b2211e4/c=0-235-3696-2323/local/-/media/2018/07/18/USATODAY/USATODAY/636675079455669859-AFP-AFP-1498D7-99386989.JPG?width=1600&height=800&fit=crop&format=pjpg&auto=webp", "site": "@usatoday", "creator": "@usatoday", "title": "David Spade: Family is doing 'as good as we can' after sister-in-law Kate Spade's death", "description": "David Spade gave an update as to how he and his family are coping following fashion designer Kate Spade's suicide on \"Good Morning America\" Wednesday."}}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1531843200.0, "source": "https://www.usatoday.com", "summary": ""}

On Tuesday, she participated in a number of events marking the 100th anniversary of the Royal Air Force and on Friday, she met with US President Donald Trump at Windsor Castle.\n\nThat said, photographer Matt Holyoak did include a hidden tribute to the British monarch in Louis's official christening photots. Just over Michael Middleton's shoulder is a portrait of the Queen.\n\n\n\nThis isn't the first time a member of the royal family missed a christening. Prince Harry was not at Princess Charlotte's christening back in 2015. According to People, he was in Africa at the time, working with endangered animals in Namibia.", "images":

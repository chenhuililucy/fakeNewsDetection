{"url": "https://www.vogue.com/article/howard-stern-celebrity-confessions", "text": "On Wednesday, it was business as usual on **Howard Stern\u2019**s Sirius XM radio show: Two celebrity guests, followed by two news-making celebrity reveals. His first guest, Jason Alexander, began casually reminiscing about his Seinfeld days\u2014like he\u2019s done many, many times before\u2014but he ended up setting the record straight on a serious Seinfeld fan theory and revealed why they killed off George Costanza\u2019s fianc\u00e9e, Susan.\n\nFans will recall that Susan (Heidi Swedberg) died rather unceremoniously while licking \u201cinexpensive envelopes\u201d for their wedding invitations. Alexander explained that the reason for her sudden departure came down to the actors\u2019 chemistry.\n\n\"The actress is this wonderful girl. I love her,\" Alexander told Stern, but explained that, like his Seinfeld character, he didn\u2019t know how to play off of her. \"We could do the most horrible things to her,\" Alexander said, \"but the audience was still on my side.\" Alexander then recalled how the rest of the cast shared his sentiment. \"Julia [Louis-Dreyfus] said, 'Don't you wanna just kill her?' And Larry [David] went 'Ka-bang!' \"\n\nStern\u2019s second guest was Jada Pinkett Smith, who also gave an extremely candid interview. The actress\u2019s marriage to Will Smith has been tabloid fodder for years, and when she visited Stern, the talk show host asked Smith to clarify her previous comments about the pair being in an open relationship.", "images": ["https://assets.vogue.com/photos/65119f7267d6a44254d221c2/4:3/pass/undefined", "https://assets.vogue.com/photos/6525ad43e24d00601b5a43ec/master/h_120%2Cc_limit/00-november-issue.jpg", "https://assets.vogue.com/photos/6525738cd5f13f5cb4b5ead0/4:3/pass/undefined", "https://assets.vogue.com/photos/589175c258aa89a00d543a1b/master/w_1600%2Cc_limit/0-howard-stern.jpg", "https://www.vogue.com/verso/static/vogue/assets/us/logo.svg", "https://assets.vogue.com/photos/589175c3f88f7c20373661eb/master/w_1600%2Cc_limit/01-oddest-celebrity-couples-madonna-tupac-shakur.jpg", "https://assets.vogue.com/photos/589175c5ce34fb453af7aeaa/master/w_1600%2Cc_limit/03-howard-stern.jpg", "https://assets.vogue.com/photos/589175c5fb0604bf1f5c33c7/master/w_1600%2Cc_limit/04-howard-stern.jpg", "https://assets.vogue.com/photos/65296c078c4ca6446927da9b/4:3/pass/undefined", "https://assets.vogue.com/photos/65089b78df85032ed2e1bb4c/4:3/pass/undefined", "https://assets.vogue.com/photos/589175c785b395961847424e/master/w_2560%2Cc_limit/00-howard-stern-holding.gif", "https://www.vogue.com/verso/static/vogue/assets/us/logo-reverse.svg", "https://assets.vogue.com/photos/652051c973f0f83c66d7184b/4:3/pass/undefined", "https://assets.vogue.com/photos/652d405a68d86ba537f12c58/4:3/pass/undefined", "https://assets.vogue.com/photos/589175c4f88f7c20373661ed/master/w_1600%2Cc_limit/02-howard-stern.jpg", "https://assets.vogue.com/photos/651ef112222d81be9be733c2/4:3/pass/undefined", "https://www.vogue.com/verso/static/vogue/assets/us/logo-header.svg", "https://www.vogue.com/verso/static/vogue/assets/account-avatar.svg", "https://assets.vogue.com/photos/652d0d03393d3c5a2b5fb4c6/4:3/pass/undefined", "https://assets.vogue.com/photos/589175c785b395961847424e/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/00-howard-stern-holding.gif", "https://assets.vogue.com/photos/6526da5f55e7a9136700f11c/4:3/pass/undefined"], "top_img": "https://assets.vogue.com/photos/589175c785b395961847424e/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/00-howard-stern-holding.gif", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Cond\u00e9 Nast", "Jessie Heyman"], "canonical_link": "https://www.vogue.com/article/howard-stern-celebrity-confessions", "title": "Celebrities Continue to Confess All to Howard Stern", "meta_data": {"msapplication-tap-highlight": "no", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "referrer": "no-referrer-when-downgrade", "author": "Cond\u00e9 Nast", "copyright": "Copyright (c) Cond\u00e9 Nast 2023", "description": "Below, we\u2019ve rounded up some of the most stunning celebrity confessions on The Howard Stern Show.", "id": "589175c797a3db337a24a80f", "keywords": "madonna,gwyneth paltrow", "news_keywords": "madonna,gwyneth paltrow", "robots": "index, follow, max-image-preview:large", "content-type": "article", "parsely-post-id": "589175c797a3db337a24a80f", "parsely-metadata": "{\"description\":\"Below, we\u2019ve rounded up some of the most stunning celebrity confessions on The Howard Stern Show.\",\"image-16-9\":\"https://assets.vogue.com/photos/589175c785b395961847424e/16:9/w_1000,c_limit/00-howard-stern-holding.gif\",\"image-1-1\":\"https://assets.vogue.com/photos/589175c785b395961847424e/1:1/w_1000,c_limit/00-howard-stern-holding.gif\"}", "og": {"image": "https://assets.vogue.com/photos/589175c785b395961847424e/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/00-howard-stern-holding.gif", "site_name": "Vogue", "title": "Celebrities Continue to Confess All to Howard Stern", "type": "article", "url": "https://www.vogue.com/article/howard-stern-celebrity-confessions"}, "article": {"content_tier": "free", "opinion": "false", "section": "tags", "published_time": "2015-06-04T15:15:54.000Z", "modified_time": "2015-06-04T15:15:54.000Z", "author": "Jessie Heyman"}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@voguemagazine", "domain": "https://www.vogue.com", "image": "https://assets.vogue.com/photos/589175c785b395961847424e/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/00-howard-stern-holding.gif?mbid=social_retweet", "site": "@voguemagazine", "title": "Celebrities Continue to Confess All to Howard Stern"}, "pinterest": {"image": "https://assets.vogue.com/photos/589175c785b395961847424e/2:3/w_1000,h_1500,c_limit/00-howard-stern-holding.gif"}, "fb": {"app_id": 812270538813681, "pages": 42933792278}}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1433430954.0, "source": "https://www.vogue.com", "summary": ""}

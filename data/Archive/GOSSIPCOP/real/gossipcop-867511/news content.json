However, that topic came up once again on Monday's Watch What Happens Live with Andy Cohen when The Real Housewives of Orange County OG stopped by to chat about the new season. And she had a very emotional response when a caller asked about her current feelings for Brooks.\n\nHow to Watch Watch The Real Housewives of Orange County on Peacock and the Bravo App.\n\n\"Why doesn't anybody talk about Donn? I was married to Donn for 20 years. I dated Brooks for 4 and a half. It's like, come on. We weren't engaged, we weren't married, it was a boyfriend for a limited bit of my time. There is no status with Brooks,\" she said. \"He has moved on; he's in Indiana. I guess he's in Indiana.\"\n\nRelated\n\nShe did, however, relay the message she would have for him should he be watching. \"'Why did you lie to me? When are you going to pay me back my money?' That's what I want to know,\" she said, before adding, \"I don't love Brooks anymore. There's no love. He was a person in my life and my past and I cared for him at that time. But, no, I don't love Brooks... Everybody move on -- he was a boyfriend; that's it.\"\n\nVicki, clearly, gets very worked up when the subject of her ex is mentioned, which made Andy Cohen's pre-show prank on the longtime Bravoleb even more intense. \"It is very amusing when you get very wound up when we mention Brooks. Right before the show, I told Vicki that we had a huge Brooks thing that we were planning to do tonight and she went nuts,\" he shared about the prank.\n\nYou can check out Vicki every Monday at 9/8c on RHOC.

But his comments about retirement seemed rather more pointed.\n\nStewart was appearing on Watch What Happens Live with Andy Cohen when a fan called in to ask him what he thought of The Rocket Man's planned retirement.\n\nStewart said: \"I did email her [Elton] and said: 'What, again dear?' And I didn't hear anything back.", "images": ["https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/news/2023/10/17/TELEMMGLPICT000353351753_16975387464680_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqpVlberWd9EgFPZtcLiMQf0Rf_Wk3V23H2268P_XkPxc.jpeg?imwidth=350", "https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/news/2023/10/17/TELEMMGLPICT000353441324_16975769665770_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqwMpl-Jpdv5EMZZkofEupHOyEA__MmDc0hQxjdbkS2u8.jpeg?imwidth=350", "https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/news/2018/03/22/TELEMMGLPICT000157138056_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqASHSSwfOlo-65bUtdmGium0sV3E9GTSwrz6GbBpLTbo.jpeg?impolicy=logo-overlay", "https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/world-news/2023/10/17/TELEMMGLPICT000353408666_16975556926850_trans_NvBQzQNjv4Bqp2ZybuEUAsPqEOEA7eklbKXqiRrGtYI-K9GGca5TxuU.jpeg?imwidth=350", "https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/news/2018/03/22/TELEMMGLPICT000157503963_trans_NvBQzQNjv4Bq4GoSUj5tx--cOXjJHDSbwwfbN67lk1wKBdzRB0qGOnc.jpeg?imwidth=480", "https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/world-news/2023/10/17/TELEMMGLPICT000353468683_16975815373230_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqwgA1tUGpm59X_5oNqLi4Door4kfIEgTeHJ9GbZ-QkEQ.jpeg?imwidth=350", "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/yBN491thtS0/mqdefault.jpg?imwidth=350", "https://www.telegraph.co.uk/etc.clientlibs/settings/wcm/designs/telegraph/core/clientlibs/ui/dist/static/resources/images/flags/USA-SVG.svg", "https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/news/2018/03/22/TELEMMGLPICT000157138056_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqASHSSwfOlo-65bUtdmGium0sV3E9GTSwrz6GbBpLTbo.jpeg?imwidth=680", "https://www.telegraph.co.uk/etc.clientlibs/settings/wcm/designs/telegraph/core/clientlibs/ui/dist/static/resources/images/flags/UK-SVG.svg"], "top_img": "https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/news/2018/03/22/TELEMMGLPICT000157138056_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqASHSSwfOlo-65bUtdmGium0sV3E9GTSwrz6GbBpLTbo.jpeg?impolicy=logo-overlay", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Telegraph Reporters", "Alex Barton", "Elsa Maishman", "Gordon Rayner", "Nataliya Vasilyeva", "Michael Searles", "James Rothwell"], "canonical_link": "https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2018/03/22/rod-stewart-says-elton-johns-farwell-tour-dishonest-stinks-selling/", "title": "Rod Stewart says Elton John's farewell tour is 'dishonest' and 'stinks of selling tickets'", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=yes", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=388947468", "msapplication-TileColor": "#2c769d", "msapplication-TileImage": "/etc.clientlibs/settings/wcm/designs/telegraph/core/clientlibs/core/resources/icons/mstile-144x144.png", "msapplication-tooltip": "The Telegraph", "msapplication-config": "/etc.clientlibs/settings/wcm/designs/telegraph/core/clientlibs/core/resources/icons/browserconfig.xml", "msapplication-square310x310logo": "/etc.clientlibs/settings/wcm/designs/telegraph/core/clientlibs/core/resources/icons/mstile-310x310.png", "msapplication-wide310x150logo": "/etc.clientlibs/settings/wcm/designs/telegraph/core/clientlibs/core/resources/icons/mstile-310x150.png", "msapplication-square150x150logo": "/etc.clientlibs/settings/wcm/designs/telegraph/core/clientlibs/core/resources/icons/mstile-150x150.png", "msapplication-square70x70logo": "/etc.clientlibs/settings/wcm/designs/telegraph/core/clientlibs/core/resources/icons/mstile-70x70.png", "theme-color": "#072A3A", "description": "Rod Stewart has criticised Elton John's retirement tour and branded it a &quot;dishonest&quot;

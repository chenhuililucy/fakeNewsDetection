I guess I made [the joke] because it was, again, so contrary to the relationship I had with Matt which was respectful, and professional. I never had an issue, never experienced anything, never witnessed anything like that. That\u2019s why I think so many people on the show were stunned when they heard about this other life he was leading.\u201d\n\nAsked whether she had ever encountered inappropriate behavior in the workplace, Couric said that she had been \u201cvery lucky, I think because I was in a position of relative power pretty early on in my career. Yes, there were men, but I think they were all afraid of me!\u201d\n\nOn the subject of Hoda Kotb\u2019s promotion to co-anchor alongside Savannah Guthrie, Couric enthused \u201cI\u2019m really happy for Hoda \u2013 I think she\u2019s a great person and her goodness shines through, I think the audience really likes her, and I think she and Savannah make a great team.\u201d", "images":

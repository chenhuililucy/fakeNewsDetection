I can only imagine it\u2019s Cary, even though I like her. I don\u2019t think they\u2019d break up the pair of Brandi and Steph, definitely not Leeanne, and I can\u2019t see them getting rid of Kameron (since she\u2019s LL\u2019s #1 ally for now) as much as I\u2019d like that. D\u2019Andra is another option but I don\u2019t think they\u2019d drop Mama Dee and she\u2019s got a set S4 storyline taking over the business and potentially rekindling (or further going after) Leeanne.

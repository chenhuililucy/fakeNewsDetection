And though the news may come as a surprise to many, it seems the couple has the approval of one of the actress' famous friends: Meghan Markle.\n\nThe Duchess of Sussex is \"very excited\" for the couple, a source told E! News. \"Everyone is very happy and they are definitely a great match,\" the insider added of the duo's inner circle.\n\nThis content is imported from poll.

Chopra, one of her longtime friends, attended both the star-studded wedding at Windsor Castle and the exclusive evening reception at Frogmore House.\n\nMore From Harper's BAZAAR\n\nIf there's any chance the Duchess will attend Chopra and Jonas' rumored nuptials, she should take a note from her fellow actress' style book when it comes to wedding-guest dressing. Chopra wore a lavender Vivienne Westwood suit for the ceremony and a stunning sparkly Dior gown for the afterparty.\n\nThough Priyanka attended the royal wedding alone, we hope Meghan goes the opposite route and brings Prince Harry when it's her turn to play wedding guest.\n\n\n\nJonas popped the question to Chopra last week in London around the time of her 36th birthday, People reports. The singer was so intent on finding the right engagement ring that he reportedly closed down a whole Tiffany & Co. store so he could pick one out.\n\nGotham // Getty Images\n\nHe and the Quantico star first stepped out together for the 2017 Met Gala, but Chopra shut down romance speculation at the time. However, they sparked romance rumors again in May after fans started spotting them out together.", "images": ["https://www.harpersbazaar.com/_assets/design-tokens/fre/static/icons/social/youtube.ce3e1ae.svg?primary=%2523ffffff&id=social-button-icon", "https://www.harpersbazaar.com/_assets/design-tokens/harpersbazaar/static/images/logos/logo.a645fa4.svg?primary=%2523ffffff", "https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/gettyimages-1715462683-6526d52e013b4.jpg?crop=0.737xw:1.00xh;0.133xw,0&resize=360:*", "https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/meghan-duchess-of-sussex-and-prince-harry-duke-of-sussex-news-photo-1696970611.jpg?crop=0.668xw:1.00xh;0,0&resize=360:*", "https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/gettyimages-1718649344-651ebd01ca0a1.jpg?crop=1.00xw:0.812xh;0,0.0156xh&resize=360:*", "https://www.harpersbazaar.com/_assets/design-tokens/fre/static/icons/social/pinterest.e8cf655.svg?primary=%2523ffffff", "https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/hbz-priyanka-chopra-nick-jonas-969830000-1532709475.jpg?crop=1xw:1xh;center,top&resize=980:*", "https://www.harpersbazaar.com/_assets/design-tokens/harpersbazaar/static/images/logos/network-logo.6416a85.svg?primary=%2523ffffff", "https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/hbz-meghan-markle-priyanka-chopra-index-1517428600.jpg?crop=1xw:1xh;center,top&resize=1200:*", "https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/gettyimages-1727573518-652591ca813cd.jpg?crop=0.939xw:0.625xh;0.0497xw,0.0395xh&resize=360:*", "https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/gettyimages-1716375030-65257a095ab6d.jpg?crop=0.604xw:0.906xh;0.255xw,0&resize=360:*", "https://www.harpersbazaar.com/_assets/design-tokens/fre/static/icons/social/pinterest.e8cf655.svg?primary=%2523ffffff&id=social-button-icon", "https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/gettyimages-1716694442-651d6eb1e2e9d.jpg?crop=0.670xw:1.00xh;0.250xw,0&resize=360:*", "https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/gettyimages-1731520592-6527fa9f9aa89.jpg?crop=1.00xw:0.515xh;0,0.0272xh&resize=360:*", "https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/gettyimages-1737697352-652c4c85b1a66.jpg?crop=0.668xw:1.00xh;0.181xw,0&resize=360:*", "https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/dsc8091-652583a1f11c7.jpg?crop=0.434xw:0.651xh;0.391xw,0.173xh&resize=360:*", "https://www.harpersbazaar.com/_assets/design-tokens/fre/static/icons/social/twitter.c44156b.svg?primary=%2523ffffff&id=social-button-icon", "https://hips.hearstapps.com/rover/profile_photos/67055711-c808-4a4d-811a-e7155a2bce10_1667409691.file?fill=1:1&resize=160:*", "https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/gettyimages-1729566146-65269cbbc3172.jpg?crop=1.00xw:0.649xh;0,0.0280xh&resize=360:*", "https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/hbz-meghan-markle-priyanka-chopra-index-1517428600.jpg?resize=640:*", "https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/gettyimages-1728281421-6525aed41eee1.jpg?crop=1.00xw:0.668xh;0,0.0962xh&resize=360:*", "https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/gettyimages-1716643662-651d619ea028b.jpg?crop=1.00xw:0.715xh;0,0.0468xh&resize=360:*", "https://www.harpersbazaar.com/_assets/design-tokens/fre/static/icons/social/instagram.f282b14.svg?primary=%2523ffffff&id=social-button-icon", "https://www.harpersbazaar.com/_assets/design-tokens/fre/static/icons/social/facebook.a5a3a69.svg?primary=%2523ffffff&id=social-button-icon", "https://www.harpersbazaar.com/_assets/design-tokens/fre/static/icons/social/instagram.f282b14.svg?primary=currentColor&id=link-out-embed", "https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/screen-shot-2023-03-06-at-7-26-43-am-6405dc309766e.png?crop=1xw:0.7805232558139535xh;center,top&resize=480:*"], "top_img": "https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/hbz-meghan-markle-priyanka-chopra-index-1517428600.jpg?crop=1xw:1xh;center,top&resize=1200:*", "keywords": [], "authors": [], "canonical_link": "https://www.harpersbazaar.com/celebrity/latest/a22575019/priyanka-chopra-nick-jonas-engaged-meghan-markle-approves/", "title": "Meghan Markle Reportedly Approves of Priyanka Chopra and Nick Jonas' Engagement", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "X-UA-Compatible": "IE=edge,chrom=1", "msapplication-tap-highlight": "no", "title": "Meghan Markle Reportedly Approves of Priyanka Chopra and Nick Jonas' Engagement", "description": "Priyanka Chopra and Nick Jonas are reportedly engaged\u200b after two months of dating.

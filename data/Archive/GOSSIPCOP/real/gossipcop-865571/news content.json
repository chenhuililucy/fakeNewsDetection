Yesterday saw Game of Thrones fans get their first glimpse at the final series when Entertainment Weekly published the first official picture for season eight. The publication also released a behind-the-scenes report on the HBO series and it hints at something very interesting. It looks like the season will feature a lot of hints toward the very first instalment.\n\nIt read: \u201cInstead of King Robert\u2019s procession arriving, it\u2019s Daenerys and her army. \u201cWhat follows is a thrilling and tense intermingling of characters \u2013 some of whom have never previously met, many who have messy histories \u2013 as they all prepare to face the inevitable invasion of the Army of the Dead.\u201d But it goes on to add that there may be tension between Sansa and Jon because of his new love interest to whom he has pledged his loyalty. The report continued: \u201cSansa isn\u2019t thrilled that Jon bent the knee to his fancy new Targaryen girlfriend, at least not at first.\u201d So, it could be that she comes round to the idea eventually. Littlefinger (Aidan Gillen) tried to plant seeds in Sansa\u2019s head about Jon betraying the North by allying himself with Daenerys in season seven. However, his devious plotting was found out and Arya (Maisie Williams) executed him as the sisters pulled off an incredible revenge plan.\n\nGame of Thrones season 8 spoilers: Jon and Sansa may have some disagreements\n\nGame of Thrones season 8 spoilers: Jon and Daenerys are yet to find out they're related\n\nAlthough there may be a disruption in Jon and Daenerys\u2019 relationship if season seven\u2019s finale was anything to go by. In the seventh run of the series, the theory that Jon is really the offspring of Lyanna Stark and Rhaegar Targaryen was finally proven. Subsequently, that makes Jon Daenrys\u2019 nephew which may act as a bit of a passion killer. However, the pair of them are none the wiser to their family connection so it could prove to be an important plot point of the final series. But fans of the fantasy epic will just have to wait and see.\n\nGame of Thrones season 8 spoilers: Jon and Sansa were reunited in the sixth series", "images": ["https://cdn.images.express.co.uk/img/dynamic/20/285x190/1039688_1.jpg", "https://cdn.images.express.co.uk/img/dynamic/20/183x122/1824407_1.jpg", "https://cdn.images.express.co.uk/img/dynamic/20/590x/secondary/Game-of-Thrones-Jon-Snow-Daenerys-1582075.jpg?r=1541150619535", "https://cdn.images.express.co.uk/img/dynamic/20/183x122/1824626_1.jpg", "https://cdn.images.express.co.uk/img/dynamic/20/183x122/1824386_1.jpg", "https://cdn.images.express.co.uk/img/dynamic/20/183x122/1824328_1.jpg", "https://cdn.images.express.co.uk/img/dynamic/20/183x122/1824475_1.jpg", "https://cdn.images.express.co.uk/img/dynamic/20/590x/secondary/Game-of-Thrones-Jon-and-Sansa-1582076.jpg?r=1541150619611", "https://cdn.images.express.co.uk/img/dynamic/20/183x122/1824289_1.jpg", "https://cdn.images.express.co.uk/img/dynamic/20/285x190/1039384_1.jpg", "https://cdn.images.express.co.uk/img/dynamic/20/183x122/1824404_1.jpg", "https://cdn.images.express.co.uk/img/dynamic/20/183x122/1824675_1.jpg", "https://cdn.images.express.co.uk/img/dynamic/20/183x122/1824620_1.jpg", "https://cdn.images.express.co.uk/img/dynamic/20/183x122/1824354_1.jpg", "https://cdn.images.express.co.uk/img/dynamic/20/183x122/1824514_1.jpg", "https://cdn.images.express.co.uk/img/dynamic/20/183x122/1824271_1.jpg", "https://cdn.images.express.co.uk/img/dynamic/20/750x445/1039836.jpg", "https://cdn.images.express.co.uk/img/dynamic/79/183x122/1824677_1.jpg", "https://cdn.images.express.co.uk/img/dynamic/20/183x122/1824530_1.jpg", "https://cdn.images.express.co.uk/img/dynamic/20/183x122/1824567_1.jpg", "https://cdn.images.express.co.uk/img/logo/dr/logo.png", "https://cdn.images.express.co.uk/img/dynamic/20/183x122/1824279_1.jpg", "https://cdn.images.express.co.uk/img/dynamic/20/285x190/1039480_1.jpg", "https://cdn.images.express.co.uk/img/dynamic/20/183x122/1824357_1.jpg", "https://cdn.images.express.co.uk/img/dynamic/20/183x122/1824283_1.jpg", "https://cdn.images.express.co.uk/img/dynamic/20/183x122/1824340_1.jpg", "https://cdn.images.express.co.uk/img/dynamic/67/183x122/1824708_1.jpg", "https://cdn.images.express.co.uk/img/dynamic/20/590x/1824442_1.jpg", "https://cdn.images.express.co.uk/img/dynamic/20/183x122/1824490_1.jpg", "https://cdn.images.express.co.uk/img/covers/70x91/front_2023-10-17.jpg", "https://cdn.images.express.co.uk/img/dynamic/20/183x122/1824571_1.jpg", "https://cdn.images.express.co.uk/img/dynamic/20/183x122/1824374_1.jpg", "https://cdn.images.express.co.uk/img/dynamic/20/183x122/1824611_1.jpg", "https://cdn.images.express.co.uk/img/dynamic/79/285x190/1039631_1.jpg", "https://cdn.images.express.co.uk/img/dynamic/20/590x/Game-of-Thrones-Jon-Snow-Sansa-Stark-1039836.jpg?r=1541150617919", "https://cdn.images.express.co.uk/img/dynamic/36/183x122/1824718_1.jpg", "https://cdn.images.express.co.uk/img/dynamic/20/183x122/1824394_1.jpg", "https://cdn.images.express.co.uk/img/dynamic/79/183x122/1824696_1.jpg", "https://cdn.images.express.co.uk/img/dynamic/20/183x122/1824637_1.jpg", "https://cdn.images.express.co.uk/img/dynamic/20/183x122/1824586_1.jpg", "https://cdn.images.express.co.uk/img/dynamic/20/183x122/1824139_1.jpg", "https://cdn.images.express.co.uk/img/dynamic/20/183x122/1824622_1.jpg", "https://cdn.images.express.co.uk/img/dynamic/35/183x122/1824679_1.jpg", "https://cdn.images.express.co.uk/img/dynamic/20/183x122/1824307_1.jpg", "https://cdn.images.express.co.uk/img/dynamic/20/590x/1824683_1.jpg"], "top_img": "https://cdn.images.express.co.uk/img/dynamic/20/750x445/1039836.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Amy Johnson"], "canonical_link": "https://www.express.co.uk/showbiz/tv-radio/1039836/Game-of-Thrones-season-8-spoilers-Jon-Snow-Sansa-Stark-Kit-Harington-GOT-HBO", "title": "Game of Thrones season 8 spoilers: Jon Snow and Sansa Stark to face tension in the final?", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "og": {"image": {"identifier": "https://cdn.images.express.co.uk/img/dynamic/20/750x445/1039836.jpg", "secure_url": "https://cdn.images.express.co.uk/img/dynamic/20/750x445/1039836.jpg", "width": 750, "height": 445, "type": "image/jpeg"}, "title": "Game of Thrones season 8: Jon Snow and Sansa Stark divided in final?", "type": "article", "url": "https://www.express.co.uk/showbiz/tv-radio/1039836/Game-of-Thrones-season-8-spoilers-Jon-Snow-Sansa-Stark-Kit-Harington-GOT-HBO", "site_name": "Express.co.uk", "language": "en", "tags": "entertainment,tv,autoplay_video,Game of Thrones,GOT,Game of Thrones spoilers,Game of Thrones season 8,GOT season 8,Jon Snow", "section": "TV & Radio", "description": "GAME OF THRONES season eight is drawing ever nearer and the details of the final instalment are being kept tightly under wraps.

(Photo by David Crotty/Patrick McMullan via Getty Images) Credit: Patrick McMullan via Getty Image\n\nBrooklynn Prince has been making the rounds during award show season, but that didn't stop her from having a bit of FOMO during the SAG Awards Sunday night.\n\nThe star of critically-acclaimed film The Florida Project sat out the Screen Actors Guild ceremony this year, but she still tuned in to see all the red carpet looks \u2014 and she found an adorable way to support her colleagues in the industry from afar.\n\nWhile her account is operated by her mom (Prince is only seven years old, after all), the photos are still hilarious. It all started with this picture of Millie Bobby Brown and Dakota Fanning. \"Whyyyyyy am I not in this picture???,\" Brooklynn said on Twitter.\n\nMoments later, thanks to a fun feature on Instagram stories, Prince inserted herself into the scene.\n\nThankfully, she did it to a host of other red carpet photos, including some brilliant pictures with Daniel Kaluuya, the stars of Lady Bird, Lupita Nyong'o and Nicole Kidman, and the legend himself, Sterling K. Brown with his wife, actress Ryan Michelle Bathe.\n\nGive Prince all the awards, please, or at least put these in the MoMA.\n\nFeatured Video For You Quit annoying your roommates and sing into this

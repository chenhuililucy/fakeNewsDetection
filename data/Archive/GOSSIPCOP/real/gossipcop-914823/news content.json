Just to remind everybody. And how many of you would vote for him again?\"\n\nShe also asked: \"Who here believes that he made the comment about, quote, 's---hole countries?'\"\n\nIt appeared the president was watching Ms Winfrey interviewing his supporters, before tweeting.", "images": ["https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/world-news/2023/10/18/TELEMMGLPICT000353502179_16976110254360_trans_NvBQzQNjv4Bq7t4Eljyiy6iRMFuEKY2dXA1vLvhkMtVb21dMmpQBfEs.jpeg?imwidth=350", "https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/politics/2023/10/18/TELEMMGLPICT000350942660_16976135916230_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqRdPLSElEmrKaK7hcQaxOdDEaMrna07McbgtNeeTYLN4.jpeg?imwidth=350", "https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/world-news/2023/10/18/TELEMMGLPICT000353442159_16976164855620_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqsXJ4x1hHApqw7ff8y1ZSzW9SclC6xq0nFwIhGI978y4.jpeg?imwidth=350", "https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/news/2018/02/19/oprah_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqqVzuuqpFlyLIwiB6NTmJwfSVWeZ_vEN7c6bHu2jJnT8.png?impolicy=logo-overlay", "https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/news/2023/10/18/TELEMMGLPICT000353496674_16976138676690_trans_NvBQzQNjv4Bq90JsMauqkzRhOnTEP_rlOiuWfxDDd81zAiUKqFKoxcE.jpeg?imwidth=350", "https://www.telegraph.co.uk/etc.clientlibs/settings/wcm/designs/telegraph/core/clientlibs/ui/dist/static/resources/images/flags/USA-SVG.svg", "https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/world-news/2023/10/17/TELEMMGLPICT000353477488_16975835455850_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqRo0U4xU-30oDveS4pXV-Vv4Xpit_DMGvdp2n7FDd82k.jpeg?imwidth=350", "https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/news/2023/10/17/TELEMMGLPICT000329842004_16975509972800_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqNiE-Mrx1NkVNK-5leJTNIKA7XnyAa7h0BY1qE0kp2IU.jpeg?imwidth=350", "https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/news/2018/02/19/oprah_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqqVzuuqpFlyLIwiB6NTmJwfSVWeZ_vEN7c6bHu2jJnT8.png?imwidth=680", "https://www.telegraph.co.uk/etc.clientlibs/settings/wcm/designs/telegraph/core/clientlibs/ui/dist/static/resources/images/flags/UK-SVG.svg"], "top_img": "https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/news/2018/02/19/oprah_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqqVzuuqpFlyLIwiB6NTmJwfSVWeZ_vEN7c6bHu2jJnT8.png?impolicy=logo-overlay", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Helena Horton", "Maighna Nanu", "Andrea Hamblin", "Our Foreign Staff", "Jack Maidment", "Chanel Zagon", "Laura Donnelly"], "canonical_link": "https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2018/02/19/donald-trump-ignites-feud-oprah-winfrey-asking-run-president/", "title": "Donald Trump dares Oprah Winfrey to run for President so he can 'expose and defeat' her", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=yes", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=388947468", "msapplication-TileColor": "#2c769d", "msapplication-TileImage": "/etc.clientlibs/settings/wcm/designs/telegraph/core/clientlibs/core/resources/icons/mstile-144x144.png", "msapplication-tooltip": "The Telegraph", "msapplication-config": "/etc.clientlibs/settings/wcm/designs/telegraph/core/clientlibs/core/resources/icons/browserconfig.xml", "msapplication-square310x310logo": "/etc.clientlibs/settings/wcm/designs/telegraph/core/clientlibs/core/resources/icons/mstile-310x310.png", "msapplication-wide310x150logo": "/etc.clientlibs/settings/wcm/designs/telegraph/core/clientlibs/core/resources/icons/mstile-310x150.png", "msapplication-square150x150logo": "/etc.clientlibs/settings/wcm/designs/telegraph/core/clientlibs/core/resources/icons/mstile-150x150.png", "msapplication-square70x70logo": "/etc.clientlibs/settings/wcm/designs/telegraph/core/clientlibs/core/resources/icons/mstile-70x70.png", "theme-color": "#072A3A", "description": "Donald Trump has fired off an angry tweet about Oprah Winfrey, objecting to her interviewing style, and daring her to run for President so he can &quot;expose and defeat&quot;

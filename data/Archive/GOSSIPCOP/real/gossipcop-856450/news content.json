Benett // Getty Images\n\n\"I think that's basically it. So, I'm going to take the high ground now and say I wish him all the best, and all success.\n\n\"Good luck to him. But we have both got kids, and I don't know what sort of example we're setting if we're arguing like we're in the playground.\"\n\nThe last time Jamie brought up the fact that both men are dads, it didn't go down too well.\n\n\"He's got four kids and I've got five kids and I don't want to be slagging off some kids' dad on telly. It's not nice,\" Jamie said in August, after comparing Gordon to someone with dementia.\n\nITV\n\nFor some reason, Gordon saw this as Jamie trying to one-up him on the number of children they have, and even as a slight against his wife Tana, who sadly had a miscarriage at five months last year.\n\n\"Jamie turned round and said, 'I've got five kids, he's got four kids'. To judge someone else's family on the amount of kids you have, that's...\" Gordon said.\n\n\"Boys will always fight and butt heads, but Tana was mortified. I mean, really mortified.\"\n\nThe pair have been feuding for years, with Jamie claiming in 2015 that Gordon is \"deeply jealous\" of him and his book sales.\n\nGetty Images\n\nThat was after Gordon criticised Jamie for failing to turn up at the opening of his own restaurant in Hong Kong.\n\nOliver said at the time: \"Gordon will do anything to try and take the piss out of me because he is deeply jealous and can't quite work out why I do what I do and why he can't do that.\n\n\"He is too busy shouting and screaming and making our industry look like a bunch of shouters and screamers.\"\n\nWant up-to-the-minute entertainment news and features?

While the past 18 years have just flown by, fans of the real-life fairytale franchise have never given up hope for a third Princess Diaries movie. And 2022 feels as fitting a time as any to bestow the world with some good news.\n\n\n\nIn recent years, traction on a trilogy-making sequel has stalled. Anne Hathaway, who played plucked-from-obscurity princess Mia Thermopolis, previously confirmed a script exists, and while she claimed to be on board for the film alongside co-star Julie Andrews as Queen Clarisse, there hadn't been many updates since. Until Disney officially greenlit a new installment.\n\nAs The Princess Diaries taught us, miracles happen once in a while if you believe. Ahead, everything we know about the status of Princess Diaries 3, including Chris Pine's involvement and Mandy Moore's surprising character theories.\n\nMore From ELLE\n\nPrincess Diaries 3 is officially happening!\n\nDisney has signed on for a third installment, The Hollywood Reporter announced on Nov. 15. TV writer Aadrita Mukerji (Reacher, Supergirl) is penning the script. The film will be a continuation of the Princess Diaries story rather than a reboot.\n\nAnne Hathaway's involvement is not yet confirmed, but \u201cthe hope is she would return should the potential new film move forward beyond the script stage,\u201d per THR. She has vocally supported the idea of a third Princess Diaries film, telling Entertainment Tonight in October, \u201cI would more than entertain it, I'm pulling for it. If there's any way to get Julie Andrews involved, I think we would make it work. We would go to where she was and put a green screen behind her and just make it happen.\u201d\n\nDebra Martin Chase, who produced the first two films, will produce the new installment and Melissa Stack (The Other Woman) will executive produce.\n\nThe film has been discussed for years.\n\nQueen Andrews herself gave an update at the time. During a virtual interview with The Talk in April, the Oscar winner managed to both inspire optimism and cast doubt when it comes to PD3. \u201cI heard that there might be one,\u201d she revealed. \u201cIt\u2019s long been talked about but nothing sort of been on my desk or anything like that. I think I would [do it]. I\u2019m getting awfully old and crotchety. I\u2019m not sure if it\u2019s the right timing, but I think to work with Annie [Anne Hathaway, who played Princess Mia] would be lovely again, and sure I\u2019d be up for it. I think we should wait for\u2014if a script comes in, let\u2019s wait for that. Of course, we wouldn\u2019t have the wonderful Gary Marshall who was the director. He\u2019s passed. And he was really the nuts and bolts of it all.\u201d\n\nThis content is imported from twitter.

She wants it to happen. Julie Andrews wants it to happen. They're working on it, she confirmed. \u201cThere is a script for the third movie.... There is a script,\u201d she said. \u201cI want to do it. Julie [Andrews] wants to do it. Debra Martin Chase, our producer, wants to do it. We all really want it to happen. It\u2019s just we don\u2019t want to unless it\u2019s perfect, because we love it just as much as you guys love it. It\u2019s as important to us as it is to you, and we don\u2019t want to deliver anything until it\u2019s ready, but we\u2019re working on it, so...\u201d\n\nThe Princess Diaries The Princess Diaries Now 13% Off $10 at Amazon\n\nPrior to Hathaway confirming there was a script, the author of The Princess Diaries book series, Meg Cabot, told Entertainment Weekly in 2017 that a script exists. She also said that if the movie gets made, it'll happen \u201ckind of as a tribute\u201d to director Garry Marshall, who passed away in 2016. But Cabot refused to reveal any further details, apart from saying that the movies would likely deviate from the book series. She said, \u201cI think of them as two different universes.\u201d\n\nGarry Marshall was reportedly planning the third installment before he died.\n\nSpeaking of Marshall, the filmmaker was also passionate about a third movie about Princess Mia. In an interview with People in March 2016, Marshall said, \"I was with Anne Hathaway a couple weeks ago. It looks like we want to do The Princess Diaries 3 in Manhattan.\" Sadly, Marshall's plan never came to fruition, but it's possible that the sequel will still be set in New York, to honor his idea.\n\nChris Pine is open to a third movie.\n\nThe actor seemed enthusiastic when asked about reprising his role as the dashing Nicholas Devereaux in 2016. After quite literally sweeping Mia off her feet at the end of the 2004 sequel, questions remain about the status of Nicholas and Mia's romance. During a fan Q&A for Entertainment Weekly in 2016, Pine was asked, \u201cDon't you pray every night for a Princess Diaries 3?\u201d To which he replied, \u201cHave you been reading my diary?\u201d\n\nPine and Hathaway in 2004. Giulio Marcocchi // Getty Images\n\nMandy Moore would consider a cameo.\n\nIn July 2017, Moore, who played mean-girl cheerleader Lana, told ELLE.com, \u201cIf I'm going to be involved, I would be down for a cameo\u2014maybe she could make amends with Mia and apologize for being a bully when she was younger. She was insecure, going through a difficult time in her life and [has now] reflected on why that wasn't okay.\u201d\n\nMoore also appeared on People Now in February 2019 and was asked what she would like to see for her character Lana. The actress had a pretty fleshed out answer: \u201cI would like to see if life kicked down a few pegs because she was the bully in school [if she comes back]. I'd like to see her is life has come full circle and maybe she's a little more well humble. I would be down!\u201d\n\n\u00a9Walt Disney Co./Courtesy Everett Collection // Everett\n\nPrincess Mia's best friend Lilly Moscovitz would come back.\n\nIn July 2016, Heather Matarazzo, who played Princess Mia's best friend Lilly Moscovitz, told Cosmopolitan that she would definitely return for another sequel. She said, \u201cIf Annie and Julie are down, of course.\u201d\n\nThe fans are ready for a royal return.\n\nIf you had concerns about the fanbase returning for a third movie, allow Twitter's evergreen excitement to ease your mind.\n\nThis content is imported from twitter.

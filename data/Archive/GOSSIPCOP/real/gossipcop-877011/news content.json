In fact, his arrest might be the best thing that ever happened to him.\n\nTwitter account Wake Mugshots found Lucky\u2019s photos by scouring police records, and Lucky \u2014 and his square jaw \u2014 soon went viral, Daily Mail reports.\n\nEven the fashion world was taken by him. Last week, Lucky signed to agency St. Claire Modeling in New York.\n\nLucky has an eye condition called heterochromia that causes his irises to have different colors.\n\nHe also has a troubled past: The 5-foot-10 model has been booked for assault and breaking and entering, as well as resisting a public officer, reports the Daily Mail.\n\nBut fans are more focused on Lucky\u2019s mug shot than his criminal history.\n\nIf Lucky\u2019s luck continues, he may follow in the footsteps of \u201cHot Felon\u201d Jeremy Meeks, whose blue eyes had New York Fashion Week aflutter in February.", "images": ["https://nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2020/10/apple-podcast-badge402x.png", "https://googleads.g.doubleclick.net/pagead/viewthroughconversion/988380111/?value=0&guid=ON&script=0", "https://nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2023/10/newspress-collage-52sqcaxc6-1697480112600.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&1697465757&w=87", "https://nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2017/08/lucky1.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&w=1024", "https://nypost.com/wp-content/mu-plugins/vip-helpers/images/vip-powered-dark-small.png", "https://nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2023/02/button_3_bg-2.png?w=206", "https://nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2023/10/Hostage-1.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&w=260&h=174&crop=1", "https://nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2023/10/NYPICHPDPICT000061744544.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&w=87", "https://decider.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/snow-white.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&w=322&h=215&crop=1", "https://nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2023/10/newspress-collage-pd0knwtcb-1697465316891.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&1697450977&w=87", "https://nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2023/10/iStock-842160124.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&w=87", "https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6390601&c3=NYPOST&cj=1&cv=3.6", "https://nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2023/10/pasta-zodiac.gif?w=87", "https://nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2023/05/CREDIBLE_USE_ONLY-What-are-the-requirements-for-a-student-loan-shutterstock_701467699.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&w=260&h=174&crop=1", "https://nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2023/10/NYPICHPDPICT000061696906.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&w=87", "https://nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2023/10/iStock-815714584.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&w=87", "https://pagesix.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2023/10/beyonce-jay-z-rumi-sir-blue-ivy-carter0-39.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&w=1024", "https://nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2023/10/alcohol-feature.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&w=87", "https://nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2017/08/lucky1.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&w=744"], "top_img": "https://nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2017/08/lucky1.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&w=1024", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Social Links For Christian Gollayan"], "canonical_link": "https://nypost.com/2017/08/31/this-guys-mug-shot-led-to-a-modeling-career/", "title": "This guy\u2019s mug shot led to a modeling career", "meta_data": {"copyright": "Copyright 2023 NYP Holdings.

Someone poured paint -- or something that looks like fake blood -- all over the President's plaque on the Walk of Fame.\n\nPlay video content TMZ.com\n\nAs we told you, we have a fixed camera across the street, and it captured footage of the culprit in action. The man appears to have been part of a PETA protest going down outside a retail store next to the star.\n\nIt didn't take long this time around for someone to start cleaning it up. It appears the swastikas from Wednesday morning had just been scrubbed before this latest incident.\n\nPlay video content 12/20/18 TMZ.com\n\nSome guy vandalized Donald Trump's star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame with swastikas ... and we got him on camera doing it.\n\nTMZ captured the crime in progress through our live stream feed on Hollywood Blvd., and you can see a man dressed in black bend down and scribble all over Trump's star. Mind you, this was done Wednesday morning around 9 AM PT ... in broad daylight.\n\nYou can see, it's already starting to fade.\n\nThe culprit does the deed quickly as people walk right by him without batting an eyelash, but two women seem to notice the tagging as he walks away. There appears to be a written message, too, using a Spanish language slur -- \"F*** This P**o\" -- and the 2 big swastikas are underneath the words.\n\nWe're told no one filed a police report about the vandalism. Of course, this is just the latest hit job the President's star has received over the past couple years.\n\nMost recently, someone drew prison bars over the star (which we also caught on camera) ... and then there was the second pickax incident earlier this summer.", "images": ["https://imagez.tmz.com/image/e9/16by9/2018/12/21/e9d1e2dce1b65c7eafadb8740c58f2ac_md.jpg",

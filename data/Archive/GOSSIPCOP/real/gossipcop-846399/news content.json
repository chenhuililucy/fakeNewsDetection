I didn\u2019t have anywhere to go.\u201d\n\nHe\u2019s now a hometown hero giving the world a piece of Houston through his music.", "images": ["https://media.khou.com/assets/KHOU/images/05616982-a619-413f-a59c-8fa546642ae6/05616982-a619-413f-a59c-8fa546642ae6_1920x1080.jpg", "https://media.khou.com/assets/KHOU/images/2642f30a-a3b1-44c5-83c9-9e1aef0d08d3/2642f30a-a3b1-44c5-83c9-9e1aef0d08d3_16x9.jpg", "https://media.khou.com/assets/KHOU/images/dc6d557f-60b4-420b-b4f8-74429c6fbb86/dc6d557f-60b4-420b-b4f8-74429c6fbb86_16x9.jpg", "https://media.khou.com/assets/WXIA/images/d8b0d07e-b1f5-4160-9877-a0aca29b6030/d8b0d07e-b1f5-4160-9877-a0aca29b6030_16x9.jpg", "https://media.khou.com/assets/WXIA/images/d8b0d07e-b1f5-4160-9877-a0aca29b6030/d8b0d07e-b1f5-4160-9877-a0aca29b6030_360x203.jpg", "https://media.khou.com/assets/KHOU/images/2642f30a-a3b1-44c5-83c9-9e1aef0d08d3/2642f30a-a3b1-44c5-83c9-9e1aef0d08d3_360x203.jpg", "https://www.khou.com/assets/shared-images/icons/twitter.svg", "https://www.khou.com/assets/shared-images/icons/facebook.svg", "https://www.khou.com/assets/shared-images/logos/khou.png", "https://media.khou.com/assets/KHOU/images/dc6d557f-60b4-420b-b4f8-74429c6fbb86/dc6d557f-60b4-420b-b4f8-74429c6fbb86_360x203.jpg", "https://www.khou.com/assets/shared-images/icons/close-menu.svg", "https://media.khou.com/assets/KHOU/images/f51db666-f537-4d7b-82ef-97e850ccfd56/f51db666-f537-4d7b-82ef-97e850ccfd56_360x203.jpg", "https://www.khou.com/assets/shared-images/weather-icons/partly-cloudy-night_210x210.png", "https://media.khou.com/assets/KHOU/images/f51db666-f537-4d7b-82ef-97e850ccfd56/f51db666-f537-4d7b-82ef-97e850ccfd56_16x9.jpg", "https://media.khou.com/assets/KHOU/images/615729045/615729045_1140x641.jpg", "https://www.khou.com/assets/shared-images/logos/native/khou.svg"], "top_img": "https://media.khou.com/assets/KHOU/images/615729045/615729045_1140x641.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": [], "canonical_link": "https://www.khou.com/article/news/entertainment-news/travis-scott-kylie-jenner-wrap-up-huge-weekend-in-houston/285-615728636", "title": "Travis Scott, Kylie Jenner wrap up huge weekend in Houston", "meta_data": {"theme-color": "#045ea8", "category": "news", "og": {"url": "https://www.khou.com/article/news/entertainment-news/travis-scott-kylie-jenner-wrap-up-huge-weekend-in-houston/285-615728636", "title": "Travis Scott, Kylie Jenner wrap up huge weekend in Houston", "description": "On Sunday, Mayor Sylvester Turner declared it \"Astroworld Day\" in Houston to recognize Scott and the debut of the Astroworld Festival.", "type": "article", "image": {"identifier": "https://media.khou.com/assets/KHOU/images/615729045/615729045_1140x641.jpg", "width": 1140, "height": 641}, "article": {"published_time": "11/18/2018 6:18:52 PM"}, "site_name": "khou.com", "locale": "en_US"}, "article": {"opinion": "false", "content_tier": "free", "section": "khou,news,entertainment-news,community,features"}, "twitter": {"title": "Travis Scott, Kylie Jenner wrap up huge weekend in Houston", "image": "https://media.khou.com/assets/KHOU/images/615729045/615729045_1140x641.jpg", "card": "summary_large_image", "site": "KHOU", "description": "On Sunday, Mayor Sylvester Turner declared it \"Astroworld Day\" in Houston to recognize Scott and the debut of the Astroworld Festival.", "domain": "www.khou.com/"}, "viewport": "width=1170", "site": "khou.com", "description": "On Sunday, Mayor Sylvester Turner declared it \"Astroworld Day\" in Houston to recognize Scott and the debut of the Astroworld Festival.", "fb": {"app_id": 1981419195445082}, "robots": "max-image-preview:large"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1542536332.0, "source": "https://www.khou.com", "summary": ""}

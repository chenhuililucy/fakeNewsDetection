Not only that, but many including her son, mother, assistant and bodyguards were all also home at the time \u2014 and at possible risk, during the time of the incident.\n\nLaw enforcement sources revealed that the man gained access to Rose\u2019s residence by breaking one of her kitchen windows and entering through her pantry. It was during the early hours of the morning; however, when the former video vixen discovered the broken window and checked her home surveillance footage to determine the cause, she discovered that a man had entered the home. She also witnessed footage of the assailant leaving the scene.\n\nShortly after, police were called. Oddly enough, according to TMZ, nothing appeared to have been stolen. It appears the man only hung out in Rose\u2019s home for a number of hours.\n\nThough Rose has yet to respond to the scary event via social media, this comes on the heels of another celebrity-related crime in Tinseltown, as armed robbers reportedly ran off with approximately $1.5M from A$AP Rocky\u2019s home.\n\n\u201cAt 11:30 pm last night officers responded to a home invasion robbery,\u201d an LAPD spokesperson told E! News of the crime, withholding the name of the victim. \u201cA female was walking outside of the home when she was confronted by three suspects and one of them was armed with a handgun. They forced the victim back into the home. They attempted to take a safe and were unsuccessful, but they took property.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, Rose\u2019s incident is currently an ongoing investigation.", "images": ["data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20width='400'%20height='221'%20viewBox='0%200%20400%20221'%3E%3C/svg%3E", "https://rollingout.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/terrell-owens-selfie-e1696335396695-400x237.png", "https://rollingout.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Screenshot-2023-10-16-at-1.48.52-PM-400x221.png", "https://rollingout.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/1669877066cropped4247x2761-400x260.jpg", "https://rollingout.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/MagicJohnson-400x300.jpg", "https://rollingout.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/480FFB90-45DB-4BF9-8572-76C2B2625035-300x300.jpeg", "https://rollingout.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/ro-logo-21.png", "https://rollingout.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/amberrosenomakeup-e1477725032178.png", "https://rollingout.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/Ruu-Hawkins_avatar_1483156460-96x96.jpg", "data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20width='300'%20height='300'%20viewBox='0%200%20300%20300'%3E%3C/svg%3E", "data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20width='400'%20height='260'%20viewBox='0%200%20400%20260'%3E%3C/svg%3E", "https://www.facebook.com/tr?id=706719784121830&ev=PageView&noscript=1", "https://rollingout.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Screenshot-2023-10-17-at-4.30.36-PM-400x300.png", "https://www.facebook.com/tr?id=666484143716324&ev=PageView&noscript=1", "https://rollingout.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/1675781911cropped2248x1461-e1696865703283-400x191.jpg", "https://rollingout.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/tyler-perry_featured_bang-scaled.jpg", "https://rollingout.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/getImgIntranet-14.jpg", "data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20width='400'%20height='237'%20viewBox='0%200%20400%20237'%3E%3C/svg%3E", "https://segment.prod.bidr.io/associate-segment?buzz_key=proclivity&segment_key=proclivity-14&value=", "https://rollingout.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/ro-logo-21-1.png", "https://www.facebook.com/tr?id=496669878759138&ev=PageView&noscript=1&cd%5Bpost_category%5D=Entertainment&cd%5Bpage_title%5D=Amber+Rose+sleeps+through+4-hour+home+invasion&cd%5Bpost_type%5D=post&cd%5Bpost_id%5D=947519&cd%5Bplugin%5D=PixelYourSite&cd%5Buser_role%5D=guest&cd%5Bevent_url%5D=rollingout.com%2F2017%2F05%2F18%2Famber-rose-sleeps-4-hour-home-invasion%2F", "data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20width='400'%20height='300'%20viewBox='0%200%20400%20300'%3E%3C/svg%3E", "data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20width='400'%20height='191'%20viewBox='0%200%20400%20191'%3E%3C/svg%3E"], "top_img": "https://rollingout.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/amberrosenomakeup-e1477725032178.png", "keywords": [], "authors": [], "canonical_link": "https://rollingout.com/2017/05/18/amber-rose-sleeps-4-hour-home-invasion/", "title": "Amber Rose sleeps through 4-hour home invasion", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "description": "Amber Rose becomes a victim of home invasion.

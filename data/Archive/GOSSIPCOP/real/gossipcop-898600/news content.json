Throughout her later life, her health began to severely decline and the glamorous jet-set lifestyle she was known for faded away; a cigarette smoker since 15, Margaret had part of her left lung removed in 1985 (an operation similar to the one her father, King George VI, underwent three decades earlier) \u2014 and though she was able to kick the habit some years later, she continued to drink heavily. The '90s brought a bout with pneumonia, a mild stroke, and a bathroom incident \u2014 during which her feet were burned from scalding-hot bathwater \u2014 that resulted in loss of mobility to her feet.\n\nBy the early 2000s, Margaret needed help walking (and would sometimes use a wheelchair), and in January and March 2001, she suffered more strokes that inhibited her vision and paralyzed her left side. By the end of that year, Margaret would make only two official public appearances; one in August for the 101st birthday party of the Queen Mother and one in December to celebrate her aunt Princess Alice's 100th birthday.\n\nMargaret was everything you'd expect a spare heir to be; she was irresistibly charming, attention-seeking, extroverted, and much more rebellious than her older sister.", "images": ["https://media1.popsugar-assets.com/files/thumbor/DglRAW5PTQHL6-XSlNIw2KEI0nw=/116x116/filters:format_auto():extract_cover()/2017/12/12/746/n/1922398/dbc7379a5a3009d4eb7df7.25215154_edit_img_front_page_image_file_44353824_1513027425.jpg", "https://media1.popsugar-assets.com/files/thumbor/NgPZPqA6M9j3TRi-YzTedpgv7wQ=/fit-in/792x598/top/filters:format_auto():upscale()/2017/12/20/059/n/1922398/tmp_VjnBUB_0be0441f63003cd4_GettyImages-545939439.jpg", "https://media1.popsugar-assets.com/files/thumbor/TiGbiwZ3FP1tplkeqslu0yKhDH4=/fit-in/5086x2657/top/filters:format_auto():quality(85):upscale()/2017/12/20/075/n/1922398/cd4812ce5a3b04df86da60.47857232_edit_img_facebook_post_image_file_44445959_1513803527.jpg", "https://media1.popsugar-assets.com/files/thumbor/34r5ztuVyh5SKPYEBQclhzIYx_A=/fit-in/792x535/top/filters:format_auto():upscale()/2017/12/20/069/n/1922398/tmp_SiOIES_3fa10878c9ba1271_GettyImages-52118006.jpg"], "top_img": "https://media1.popsugar-assets.com/files/thumbor/TiGbiwZ3FP1tplkeqslu0yKhDH4=/fit-in/5086x2657/top/filters:format_auto():quality(85):upscale()/2017/12/20/075/n/1922398/cd4812ce5a3b04df86da60.47857232_edit_img_facebook_post_image_file_44445959_1513803527.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Britt Stephens", "Updated On At Pm"], "canonical_link": "https://www.popsugar.com/celebrity/how-did-princess-margaret-die-44445959", "title": "How Did Princess Margaret Die?

Look, here it is stacked next to her massive engagement bling:\n\nGetty Images\n\nThis content is imported from poll. You may be able to find the same content in another format, or you may be able to find more information, at their web site.\n\nPrince William, on the other hand, wears approximately NOTHING on his finger. Here he is meeting Paddington Bear, where you can see pretty clearly that he's not wearing a wedding band. And yes, maybe I took this as an opportunity to post a photo of Paddington Bear. No regrets.\n\nGetty Images\n\nSo, now that we've established that William doesn't wear a ring, a couple of questions remain....\n\nMore From Cosmopolitan\n\n1. Did Kate Give Wills a Ring on Their Wedding Day?\n\nAnswer: Nope! Here's a video of their ceremony, where you can plainly see William pop a ring on Kate, and she pop nothing on him in return:\n\nAnd here's a GIF in case your boss frowns on you watching ancient royal wedding videos at work:\n\nGetty Images\n\n2. Do Most Royal Men Wear Wedding Rings?\n\nIt depends, but mostly yes! Prince Charles wore a wedding band stacked behind his pinkie signet ring when he married Princess Diana:\n\nGetty Images\n\nAnd nowadays he wears a similar one as a symbol of his marriage to Camilla:\n\nGetty Images\n\nMeanwhile, Prince William's brother Prince Harry has been wearing a wedding ring since his marriage to Meghan Markle:\n\nGetty Images\n\nThat said, Prince Philip (Queen Elizabeth's husband) doesn't wear a ring\u2014so it's not like William is fully alone on a ring-less island.\n\n3. So, Why Did William Opt Out?\n\nThe reason comes down to personal preference. Royal biographer Penny Junor told Vogue, \"He doesn\u2019t like jewelry, and the Palace issued a statement before their wedding saying so.\"\n\nThis is true, though it was less of a \"statement\" and more of an anonymous tip from a palace aide to veteran royal reporter Rebecca English. \"It was something the couple discussed but Prince William isn't one for jewelry\u2014he doesn't even wear a signet ring\u2014and decided he didn't want to,\" the aide confirmed. \"It really is just down to personal preference.\"\n\nThe aide also claimed that Kate was completely fine with William's decision, adding, \"It is quite common for men in that strata of society not to wear a traditional wedding band. If they do, they tend to wear it with their family signet ring but William doesn't have one of those.\"\n\nWelp, there you have it. Kay, bye-bye as you were!\n\nGiphy\n\nThis content is imported from poll.

Because like most men I had what you could refer to as retro bush.\n\n\"Joel the director kind of went 'ooh' and I went 'Okay, I'll trim it'.\"\n\nAnd from here, the story only gets better and Farrell has the audience - and Ellen - in absolute stitches.\n\n\"I went into my trailer, got a bin and put it there. I sat over the bin and I got the beard trimmer and I was nervous. I trimmed the right side a little bit and obviously had to match it, so I trimmed the left but I overshot the mark a little bit.\n\n\"So I had to get back in and approach the right again, and I overshot that, and at this stage I was just sweating. I went back in and reapproached the landing on the left. And then I looked down and I had a little landing strip. A lovely, lovely little landing strip.\"\n\nFarrell may have been a bit embarrassed telling the story but he raised a heap of money for charity.\n\nIn return for his confession, Ellen awarded him $10,000 for The Chime Institute, a chartered school which is a fully inclusive school where 10% of every class is special education.\n\nA brilliant story for a brilliant cause.", "images": ["https://www.irishexaminer.com/cms_media/module_img/7601/3800680_4_teasersmall_2.66100345.jpg.jpg", "https://www.irishexaminer.com/pu_examiner/images/shareIcon.svg", "https://www.irishexaminer.com/cms_media/module_img/7608/3804289_437_teasersmall_bf3f39b4-3950-4562-a95b-077e8da8e124-1-e1697558704667.jpg", "https://www.irishexaminer.com/cms_media/module_img/5661/2830680_1_org_IE_logo_white.png", "https://www.irishexaminer.com/cms_media/module_img/1398/699032_1_seoimageog_bn-788842_1252472242d94fae87720e8ad81ce50f.jpg", "https://www.irishexaminer.com/cms_media/module_img/7600/3800176_3_teasersmall_2.729828.jpg.jpg", "https://www.irishexaminer.com/cms_media/module_img/5424/2712132_1_org_1715999_1_org_dove_squoosh.png", "https://www.irishexaminer.com/pu_examiner/images/f-logo-nbi.png", "https://www.irishexaminer.com/cms_media/module_img/7607/3803785_565_teasersmall_2-64715404-1-e1642604827586.jpg", "https://www.irishexaminer.com/cms_media/module_img/5424/2712141_1_org_1716002_1_org_XXLogosquoosh.png", "https://www.irishexaminer.com/cms_media/module_img/1398/699032_1_articlesmall_bn-788842_1252472242d94fae87720e8ad81ce50f.jpg", "https://www.irishexaminer.com/pu_examiner/images/IAB-logo-white.png", "https://www.irishexaminer.com/pu_examiner/images/Irish_Examiner_logo.png", "https://www.irishexaminer.com/pu_examiner/images/f-logo2.png", "https://www.irishexaminer.com/cms_media/module_img/7598/3799393_3_teasersmall_e96557d6e9164567bfb565cb9947034d.jpg.jpg", "https://www.irishexaminer.com/cms_media/module_img/7606/3803155_3_augmentedSearch_fcb6332532e2435db56fe150c6213d0e.jpg.jpg", "https://www.irishexaminer.com/cms_media/module_img/7590/3795499_288_teasersmall_2-72818987-e1697090377285.jpg"], "top_img": "https://www.irishexaminer.com/cms_media/module_img/1398/699032_1_seoimageog_bn-788842_1252472242d94fae87720e8ad81ce50f.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Steve Neville", "Tue", "May"], "canonical_link": "https://www.irishexaminer.com/lifestyle/celebrity/arid-30788842.html", "title": "Colin Farrell's close shave with manscaping had Ellen DeGeneres in tears", "meta_data": {"msapplication-TileColor": "#da532c", "theme-color": "#ffffff", "pragma": "no-cache", "cache-control": "no-store, no-cache, must-revalidate, post-check=0, pre-check=0, proxy-revalidate", "generator": "redFACT7 CMS, powered by www.newsfactory.de", "do_paywall": "true", "do_count": "true", "keywords": "Courts,Heathrow,colin farrell,Ellen,Showbiz", "viewport": "width=device-width", "news_keywords": "Courts,Heathrow,colin farrell,Ellen,Showbiz,Steve Neville", "robots": "max-image-preview:large", "description": "Farrell had the audience - and Ellen - in absolute stitches.", "og": {"type": "article", "image": {"identifier": "https://www.irishexaminer.com/cms_media/module_img/1398/699032_1_seoimageog_bn-788842_1252472242d94fae87720e8ad81ce50f.jpg", "width": 1200, "height": 630}, "url": "https://www.irishexaminer.com/lifestyle/celebrity/arid-30788842.html", "title": "Colin Farrell's close shave with manscaping had Ellen DeGeneres in tears", "site_name": "Irish Examiner", "description": "Farrell had the audience - and Ellen - in absolute stitches."}, "article": {"published_time": "2017-05-09T10:49:00+01:00", "publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/irishexaminer", "section": "IE-Lifestyle/CELEBRITY", "tag": "IE-Lifestyle/CELEBRITY"}, "fb": {"app_id": 297058297106710}, "twitter": {"dnt": "on", "image": "https://www.irishexaminer.com/cms_media/module_img/1398/699032_1_articlelarge_bn-788842_1252472242d94fae87720e8ad81ce50f.jpg", "card": "summary_large_image", "site": "@irishexaminer", "title": "Colin Farrell's close shave with manscaping had Ellen DeGeneres in tears", "description": "Farrell had the audience - and Ellen - in absolute stitches.", "domain": "irishexaminer.com", "app": {"name": {"iphone": "Irish Examiner", "ipad": "Irish Examiner", "googleplay": "Irish Examiner"}, "id": {"iphone": 662222158, "ipad": 662222158, "googleplay": "ie.irishexaminer.mobile"}}, "url": "https://www.irishexaminer.com/lifestyle/celebrity/arid-30788842.html"}, "pageType": "article", "author": "Steve Neville", "articleID": 30788842, "language": "en"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1494323340.0, "source": "https://www.irishexaminer.com", "summary": ""}

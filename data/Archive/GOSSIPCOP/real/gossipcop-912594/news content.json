(Getty)\n\nGabrielle Union is on the March 2018 issue of Redbook magazine, and in the accompanying interview, she opened up about her struggle with self-worth.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve struggled with feelings of worthlessness for a very long time, probably until about last year, even though I had a body of work and I\u2019m pretty accomplished,\u201d Union admitted to the mag.\n\nUnion also admitted that her decision to open up about her experience with sexual abuse had triggered her PTSD, but she wanted to tell her story because she felt \u201ca responsibility to offer that sense of safety and support.\u201d Though she has talked about her sexual abuse for years in public, Union\u2019s best-selling memoir We\u2019re Going to Need More Wine and the rise of the #MeToo movement brought her story and the stories of so many others to the forefront.\n\nLooking forward with positivity\n\nHer own safety net, she said, included her therapist and life coach, who had helped her to look forward and to look at the positive things in life.\n\nTo that end, Union has a \u201chappy list\u201d of the good things she has in her world as well as a vision board of the things she\u2019d like to accomplish.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve been able to look at my boards and say, \u2018Damn, I put in a lot of work and deserve it.\u2019 That\u2019s helped me to stop feeling suspicious of joy. To not sabotage something before I\u2019ve had a chance to do it because I assume I\u2019ll be rejected,\u201d she said.\n\nUnion, who has been open about her struggles with infertility and the emotional journey that comes with it, said that having a baby is definitely on that vision board: \u201cThe only things that have not come to pass are a cosmetics line, Machu Picchu, and a baby\u2026 I\u2019ll put those things back on this year\u2019s board and see what happens.\u201d\n\nAlso on the board? \u201cFlawless by Gabrielle Union,\u201d the hair care line that she launched last year for women with textured hair. Union will also be launching the second season of her clothing line this month.\n\nShe did not mention if heading back to Miami was on her vision board, but she and her husband Dwyane Wade are saying hello again to the sunshine state now that he has been traded from the Cleveland Cavaliers to the Miami Heat. Union tweeted her excitement about the move.\n\n????????? 305 HOME!!!! Let\u2019s goooooooo HEAT!!!! Can\u2019t. Wait. \u2014 Gabrielle Union (@itsgabrielleu) February 8, 2018\n\nLooks like Union just got another big item to add to her happy list.", "images":

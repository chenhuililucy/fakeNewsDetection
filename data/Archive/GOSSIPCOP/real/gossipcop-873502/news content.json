I appreciate your engagement, your support and, mostly, your reciprocated snark.\n\nI am absolutely certain Katy Primosch will do a wonderful job every week moving forward. I am excited to follow along.\n\nI am also always available anywhere on social media @abbydraper to discuss all things \u201cBachelor.\u201d Or Tim Riggins.\n\nThank you, guys, for the fun. Don\u2019t be a stranger. Now, back to your regularly scheduled recap:\n\nHi, my name is Katy, and I\u2019m a Bachelor-holic. I\u2019ll be taking the reins from the infamous Abby Draper for your \u201cBachelor\u201d franchise recaps, and while I couldn\u2019t possibly fill her shoes, I\u2019ll fill my wine glass and hope for the best.\n\nWelcome to Season 4 of \u201cBachelor in Paradise.\u201d After seeing the trailer for this season during last week\u2019s \u201cBachelorette\u201d finale, I\u2019m left wondering how much ABC paid the standards department to look the other way on this season\u2019s content. It is entirely possible that Chris Harrison\u2019s ubiquitous promise of \u201cthe most dramatic season ever\u201d may finally ring true.\n\nWe open to shots of an empty resort with dramatic music and audio clips of news stories about the \u201cBachelor in Paradise\u201d production shutdown in the background. Chris Harrison strolls in and sounds downright cheerful, which is weird, because he\u2019s here to give background about the \u201caccusations and allegations\u201d of potential sexual misconduct that led to a decision to halt production 2 1/2 days into filming. Chris explains that before addressing what happened, the show will recap what happened before production halted, and we begin the episode.\n\nTHE ENTRANCES\n\nRaven, the dark-haired dark horse from Nick\u2019s season, is the first to enter. She drops every Bachelor Nation platitude in her first breath, and she\u2019s looking for a Jade and Tanner love story, but a Carly and Evan one would be OK too. Ouch.\n\nDeanie-baby is next, and he might be wearing silk boxers instead of a swim suit.\n\nNext up is Kristina, the fan-favorite Russian beauty who is now a blonde. She says it feels like a 2-on-1 date, and there must be another boy coming next \u2026 which of course means another girl will arrive.\n\nDanielle M. enters and immediately ends every sentence with a comment about how hot Dean is.\n\nBen Z. joins the crew with an eye for Raven. He pulls her aside and launches in to a monologue about his dog and possibly his entire pet ownership history. He says his dog, Zeus, needs a dog mom, and even I, a crazy dog lady, am weirded out.\n\nFinally, we get a romantic embrace \u2014 between Dean and new-arrival Iggy.\n\nFormer Disney princess Jasmine arrives and is looking forward to meeting the guys from Rachel\u2019s season, in particular.\n\nJack Stone, who everyone agrees is not just Jack but Jack Stone, appears and goes on the record that he is NOT a serial killer as everyone thought during Rachel\u2019s season.\n\nThere\u2019s a gap in my notes here, because Alexis walks up the beach path in her shark suit, and I\u2019m laughing hysterically and screaming with joy. She is an American treasure.\n\nThere\u2019s a break in the arrivals for everyone to grab a drink and begin gossiping. The ladies gather to discuss Demario and whether he really had a girlfriend while on Rachel\u2019s season. They appear to be very anti-Demario, and say they hope he won\u2019t show up, so of course \u2026 he shows up. Who would have thought?\n\nDemario wants to set everything straight, but he doesn\u2019t really answer Chris Harrison\u2019s questions, and he still refers to the events of last season as \u201chappening to him.\u201d He sees that Raven is clearly the pack leader and attempts to get to her to plead his case and show her he\u2019s in paradise for the right reasons. Raven is conciliatory, but then the show cuts to an interview of her that shows she\u2019s not quite buying it.\n\nAfter the heart-to-heart, Derek sneaks in and has to introduce himself as the one who cried on JoJo\u2019s season, because no one saw him come in and no one knows who he is.\n\nHis frenemy and Chief Narrator, Alex, joins the cast. He\u2019s excited to see his buddy Derek, who is simultaneously suggesting that Alex might be overcompensating for something.\n\nCorinne tells Chris Harrison she\u2019s \u201cMaking Paradise Corinne Again,\u201d and I\u2019m not sure how that works, but I\u2019m quickly distracted by Corinne\u2019s stellar language skills. She learned how to say \u201cnap,\u201d \u201ccheesy pasta,\u201d and \u201cchampagne\u201d in Spanish. She\u2019s in charge and is ready to have a siesta fiesta.\n\n\u201cCamel girl,\u201d aka Lacey, joins the group, and Iggy is already interested. It seems to be reciprocated, but the dream is short-lived because, unfortunately, Lacey has to leave immediately to attend to a death in the family at home.\n\nVinny and Diggy make nondescript entrances and remain boring for the rest of the episode.\n\nWhile we wait for the remainder of the cast, we are treated to flirtation and a back massage between Demario and Corinne, and another cute chat between Dean and Kristina.\n\nAlex delivers some snark about guys who rely on gimmicks, just as Matt the penguin, and St. Nick arrive in their respective costumes. Not to be out-snarked, Matt says Nick\u2019s Santa Claus beard is a cop-out and he should have gone for a full costume.\n\nImmediately, Nick confesses that he\u2019s in paradise specifically to meet Jasmine and they have the first kiss of the day after a dare.\n\n\u201cBachelor in Paradise\u201d veteran Amanda is back for another shot at love. Her engagement to World\u2019s Worst Dude Josh Murray didn\u2019t work out \u201cbecause he\u2019s a sweaty person.\u201d She returns her Neil Lane engagement ring to Chris Harrison and (in my favorite moment of the night) he takes a sniff and says the ring smells like pizza.", "images": ["https://web.archive.org/web/20170815224727im_/http://www.trbimg.com/img-5991d259/turbine/bs-fe-mike-rowe-facebook-show-20170814/70/70x70", "https://web.archive.org/web/20170815224727im_/http://www.trbimg.com/img-5991d71d/turbine/bs-fe-game-of-thrones-episode-5-season-7/70/70x70", "https://web.archive.org/web/20170815224727im_/http://www.trbimg.com/img-59933669/turbine/bs-fe-bachelor-in-paradise-recap-season-4-episode-1", "https://web.archive.org/web/20170815224727im_/http://www.trbimg.com/img-5992fc92/turbine/bs-fe-liris-crosse-project-runway-20170811/70/70x70", "https://web.archive.org/web/20170815224727im_/http://pixel.sitescout.com/iap/796cee1a34239f32"], "top_img": "https://web.archive.org/web/20170815224727im_/http://www.trbimg.com/img-59933669/turbine/bs-fe-bachelor-in-paradise-recap-season-4-episode-1", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Katy Primosch"], "canonical_link": "https://web.archive.org/web/20170815224727/http://www.baltimoresun.com/entertainment/tv/tv-lust/bs-fe-bachelor-in-paradise-recap-season-4-episode-1-story.html", "title": "'Bachelor in Paradise' premiere recap: What happened before the shutdown", "meta_data": {"robots": "index,follow", "author": "Katy Primosch", "date": "2017-08-15", "copyright": "Copyright (c) 2017 Baltimore Sun", "Description": "The season premiere of \"Bachelor in Paradise\" alludes to the controversy that shut down production", "keywords": "Bachelor in Paradise, premiere, recap, controversy, shutdown, Corinne, Demario", "news_keywords": "Bachelor in Paradise, premiere, recap, controversy, shutdown, Corinne, Demario", "fb_title": "'Bachelor in Paradise' premiere recap: What happened before the shutdown", "og": {"title": "'Bachelor in Paradise' premiere recap: What happened before the shutdown", "description": "The season premiere of \"Bachelor in Paradise\" alludes to the controversy that shut down production", "type": "article", "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20170815224727/http://www.baltimoresun.com/entertainment/tv/tv-lust/bs-fe-bachelor-in-paradise-recap-season-4-episode-1-story.html", "image": "https://web.archive.org/web/20170815224727im_/http://www.trbimg.com/img-59933669/turbine/bs-fe-bachelor-in-paradise-recap-season-4-episode-1", "site_name": "baltimoresun.com"}, "fb": {"page_id": 9299179711, "app_id": 310302989040998, "pages": 9299179711}, "twitter": {"card": "summary", "site": "@baltimoresun"}, "googlebot": "index", "googlebot-news": "index", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=496681035, app-argument=http://www.baltimoresun.com/deeplinkid/94342563", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, minimum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no", "x-servername": "i15prod-3c1c3e6-0-199.1", "so": {"status": "5,1"}}, "movies": [], "publish_date": null, "source": "https://web.archive.org", "summary": ""}

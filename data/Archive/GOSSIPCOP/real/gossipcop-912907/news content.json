So, while it\u2019s no surprise that we see Selena love coming from the young singer, it was such a cute thrill to see her sporting a vintage Selena t-shirt.\n\nCelebrities love to wear Selena Quintanilla tees! We\u2019ve seen Drake and Kylie Jenner pay tribute to the singer via fashion, so it\u2019s very cool to see Selena Gomez share the love as well.\n\nIn 2016, Selena Gomez talked about how much her parents loved Selena Quintanilla, and what it was like to meet her family.\n\n\u201cMy dad and mom were huge fans. My name was going to be Priscilla, but my cousin actually took the name when she was born six months before me. They actually loved [Selena\u2019s] music, so they just named me after her,\u201d Selena Gomez said on a radio interview with Sacramento\u2019s NOW 100.5. \u201cI grew up and I went to her grave,\u201d Selena Gomez says about the Mexican-American superstar. \u201cI got to go to her house. It was really crazy. And then when I started working, I remember I got to meet her family and I just got super emotional \u2019cause it\u2019s so crazy to see how far everything \u2026 I don\u2019t know where she\u2019d be right now. It\u2019s nuts.\u201d\n\nNow back to this coveted t-shirt that she wore this week. Many are wondering where they can get that exact shirt. We\u2019ve done some major digging on the internet, and there\u2019s so many different styles that bear Selena\u2019s face or her name on t-shirts. There\u2019s so many varieties. So while we couldn\u2019t find that exact one, we found several just like it.\n\nTake a look and let us know which one is your favorite!\n\nPoshmark for $29.\n\nHot Topic for $22.90.\n\nForever 21 for $15.90.\n\nBonanza $19.90", "images": ["https://hiplatina.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2023/10/latinas-calladitas-no-more-e1697576176264.jpg?resize=132,74&quality=80", "https://hiplatina.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2023/10/latinas-calladitas-no-more-e1697576176264.jpg?resize=480,270&quality=80", "https://hiplatina.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2018/02/00254129-02.jpg", "https://hiplatina.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2022/10/latin-urban-legends.jpg?resize=150,150&quality=80", "https://hiplatina.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2018/02/m_58b8ece3c6c795377c00f8e1.jpg", "https://hiplatina.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2018/02/40715518_010_b.jpeg", "https://hiplatina.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2022/03/eva-longoria.jpg?resize=150,150&quality=80", "https://hiplatina.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2023/10/hillary-heron.jpeg?resize=480,270&quality=80", "https://hiplatina.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2023/10/jennifer-vasquez-goth-blogger.jpg?resize=132,74&quality=80", "https://hiplatina.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2018/02/s-l1600.jpg", "https://hiplatina.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2023/10/Katya-Echazarreta-Barbie-Auction-1.jpg?resize=480,270&quality=80", "https://hiplatina.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2018/07/191125_Selena_Gomez_at_the_2019_American_Music_Awards_cropped-e1600803323630.png?h=740", "https://hiplatina.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2023/09/activists.jpg?resize=150,150&quality=80", "https://hiplatina.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2023/10/jennifer-vasquez-goth-blogger.jpg?resize=480,270&quality=80", "https://hiplatina.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2022/03/eva-longoria.jpg?resize=480,270&quality=80", "https://hiplatina.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2023/10/indigenous-heroes-latin-america.jpg?resize=480,270&quality=80", "https://hiplatina.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2023/10/indigenous-heroes-latin-america.jpg?resize=132,74&quality=80", "https://hiplatina.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2023/08/Sargento_Receta-Ariana.jpg?resize=150,150&quality=80", "https://hiplatina.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2018/07/191125_Selena_Gomez_at_the_2019_American_Music_Awards_cropped-e1600803323630.png?resize=360,270&quality=80", "https://hiplatina.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2023/10/delia-giandeini-7FtM9dZ9ck8-unsplash.jpg?resize=132,74&quality=80", "https://hiplatina.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2023/10/delia-giandeini-7FtM9dZ9ck8-unsplash.jpg?resize=480,270&quality=80", "https://hiplatina.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2018/02/10981429_hi-889x1200.jpeg", "https://hiplatina.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2023/10/selena-gomez-food-network-holiday.png?resize=480,270&quality=80"], "top_img": "https://hiplatina.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2018/07/191125_Selena_Gomez_at_the_2019_American_Music_Awards_cropped-e1600803323630.png?h=740", "keywords": [], "authors": [], "canonical_link": "https://hiplatina.com/selena-gomez-t-shirt/", "title": "Selena Wears Selena!

You may be able to find the same content in another format, or you may be able to find more information, at their web site.\n\nIn case you missed it, on this season of The Bachelor, Arie Luyendyk Jr. first proposed to Becca Kufrin, then broke up with her while cameras were filming, then went back to the woman he initially rejected, Lauren Burnham, and now they're engaged. (Phew!) Now that the dust has settled, Arie explained during an interview on Good Morning America that he filmed the breakup to show the world that this was his fault, not Becca\u2019s, so she could go on to be the next star of The Bachelorette:\n\n\"I really wanted everyone to know that this was on me. This was my fault, and I felt like filming that would let people know that, that if there were any questions on the breakup, those would be squashed if they saw the breakup. And I wanted her that opportunity, honestly, I wanted her that opportunity to be the potential Bachelorette.\"\n\nBecca and Arie hash it out on After the Final Rose. ABC\n\nArie also said that he felt pressure to propose during The Bachelor\u2019s taping, even though he wasn\u2019t fully sure about it. \u201cAs a Bachelor, there\u2019s a timeline. And for me, there was a lot of pressure on that day, being the Bachelor, and to propose, that\u2019s sort of what\u2019s expected in a way,\u201d he told host Michael Strahan. \u201cI was really conflicted, and I felt in the moment that was the right decision, and it honestly wasn\u2019t.\u201d He said he started to regret his decision right after getting home from Peru, where the proposal was filmed. \u201cIn hindsight, no, I shouldn\u2019t have proposed,\u201d Arie said.\n\nHe told Strahan he hadn\u2019t seen Becca since their breakup, until he apologized to her on After the Final Rose. \u201cI hope I gave her a little bit of closure,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m very happy for her, I\u2019m happy that she\u2019s going to be able to find her true love through the show.\u201d\n\nMore From Cosmopolitan\n\nThat said, E! asked Chris Harrison to weigh in on Arie's spin, and he shut it down: \"That's a decision that the Bachelors are never involved in,\" Harrison said of the producers' process in picking the Bachelorette. So there you go.", "images": ["https://hips.hearstapps.com/vidthumb/images/screen-shot-2022-02-03-at-3-13-42-pm-1643919322.jpg?crop=0.9962319639738993xw:1xh;center,top&resize=480:*",

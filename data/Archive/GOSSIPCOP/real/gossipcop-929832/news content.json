But, apparently, not everyone knows that.\n\nSome Twitter users are trying to wrap their heads around the existence of J.D. Scott, while others posted reactions to a throwback photo unearthed by BuzzFeed writer Brad Esposito. Scott himself is also getting in on the fun as users liken his previous look to Fall Out Boy's Pete Wentz, Joan Jett, and \"an Adam Lambert impersonator.\"\n\n\"There was method to that madness,\" Scott tweeted to Esposito of the photo. And as it turns out, Scott was actually a Lambert impersonator at one point in his career, he revealed in a Twitter exchange.\n\nAccording to his profile on the Scott brothers' website, he also impersonated David Bowie during a stint in Las Vegas. In 2014, he shared a video of one of his final performances at the Imperial Palace with a Pink impersonator. <iframe src=\"https://www.facebook.com/plugins/post.php?href=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.facebook.com%2FMRJDSCOTT%2Fposts%2F669463779800964&width=500\" width=\"500\" height=\"430\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"0\" allowtransparency=\"true\" class=\"\" allowfullscreen=\"\" resize=\"0\" replace_attributes=\"1\" name=\"\"></iframe>\n\nScott was also a member of the Canadian sketch comedy ensemble YFG and the Loose Moose Improv group, and he's worked both in front of and behind the camera on various projects. Now, as he says, he's \"all @hgtv.\"\n\n\"A fitting #tbt photo for sure,\" he added of the image on Instagram. \"I think the internet has mashed @mrsilverscott and me up, he's the illusionist. I was an Adam Lambert impersonator years ago which accounts for that awesome emo hair.\"\n\nScott was recently spotted in PEOPLE's cover story on Dave and Jonathan. \"I have been getting texts, emails and social media messages all week from friends saying \u2018I saw you in @people magazine!'\" he tweeted. \"What an honor.\"\n\n\"We've always gotten along,\" he told the magazine of his brothers. \"We're great friends.\"\n\nSee more reactions to his throwback picture below.", "images": ["https://ew.com/thmb/mVlhJ7ENo-tw6l6P-5wdGJ4Vqwg=/75x75/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/nick-romano-image-e257b019c52d41e2a2acdfa2828dcbd0.png", "https://ew.com/thmb/b3pBXxkP34aK9wyMTssp93mjyLw=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/gettyimages-454166460-2000-ddf6f861c7714b519c11a516f224a048.jpg"], "top_img": "https://ew.com/thmb/b3pBXxkP34aK9wyMTssp93mjyLw=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/gettyimages-454166460-2000-ddf6f861c7714b519c11a516f224a048.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Ew'S Editorial Guidelines"], "canonical_link": "https://ew.com/tv/2017/04/07/property-brothers-jd-scott/", "title": "Property Brothers: J.D.

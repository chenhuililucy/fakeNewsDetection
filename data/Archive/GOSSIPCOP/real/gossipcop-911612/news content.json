Please look at the time stamp on the story to see when it was last updated.\n\nFunnyman actor Kevin Hart provided some comic relief at the Super Bowl \u2013 but he was laughed at more than laughed with.\n\nHart, who is a native of Philadelphia, seems to have gotten his party on at Super Bowl LII.\n\nThe comedic actor was super happy that the Philadelphia Eagles pulled off a win. So happy that Hart crashed a post-game NFL Network interview with an Eagles player.\n\nThings went left and Hart ended up dropping an F-bomb live on national TV, before escorting himself off the set.\n\nBut the \u201cJumanji\u201d star received the most attention from social media after security denied his attempt to join the champion Eagles on stage for the trophy presentation.\n\nFootage of the moment quickly went viral and fans had a laugh about it on social media, some noting the actor\u2019s small stature as he reportedly is 5 feet 4 inches tall.\n\nFor his part, Hart explained in an Instagram video posted Monday that he was \u201ctipsy.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou know when alcohol is in your system you do dumb stuff,\u201d Hart said.\n\n\u201cTrying to go on stage with the trophy definitely\u201d is one of the \u201cstupidest things I\u2019ve ever done but who cares? The Eagles won the Super Bowl.\u201d\n\nCNN has reached out to Hart for additional comment.", "images": ["https://wgntv.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/5/2022/01/GettyImages-1283128541.jpg?strip=1",

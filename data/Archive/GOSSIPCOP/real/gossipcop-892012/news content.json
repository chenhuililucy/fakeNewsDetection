As to how it fits into my own pattern, I imagine I'll be figuring that out for years to come.\"\n\nIn response to Hunter's story, Hoffman told THR in a statement, \"I have the utmost respect for women and feel terrible that anything I might have done could have put her in an uncomfortable situation. I am sorry. It is not reflective of who I am.\"", "images": ["https://web.archive.org/web/20171107182913im_/http://www.etonline.com/sites/default/files/styles/max_1280x720/public/images/2017-11/streep_hoffman_1280_8054848.jpg?itok=wog9ISZs"], "top_img": "https://web.archive.org/web/20171107182913im_/http://www.etonline.com/sites/default/files/styles/max_1280x720/public/images/2017-11/streep_hoffman_1280_8054848.jpg?itok=wog9ISZs", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Jackie Willis"], "canonical_link": "https://web.archive.org/web/20171107182913/http://www.etonline.com/meryl-streep-says-comments-made-about-dustin-hoffman-resurfaced-interview-are-not-accurate", "title": "Meryl Streep Says Comments Made About Dustin Hoffman in Resurfaced Interview are Not an 'Accurate Rendering'", "meta_data": {"title": "Meryl Streep Says Comments Made About Dustin Hoffman in Resurfaced Interview are Not an 'Accurate Rendering' | Entertainment Tonight", "fb": {"pages": 106843036179, "admins": 3111204, "app_id": 145337045558621}, "og": {"site_name": "Entertainment Tonight", "type": "Article", "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20171107182913/http://www.etonline.com/meryl-streep-says-comments-made-about-dustin-hoffman-resurfaced-interview-are-not-accurate", "title": "Meryl Streep Says Comments Made About Dustin Hoffman in Resurfaced Interview are Not an 'Accurate Rendering'", "description": "\"There was an offense and it is something for which Dustin apologized,\" the actress' rep told ET in a statement.", "image": "https://web.archive.org/web/20171107182913im_/http://www.etonline.com/sites/default/files/styles/max_1280x720/public/images/2017-11/streep_hoffman_1280_8054848.jpg?itok=wog9ISZs"}, "robots": "index", "apple-mobile-web-app-capable": "yes", "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "title": "Meryl Streep Says Comments Made About Dustin Hoffman in Resurfaced Interview are Not an 'Accurate Rendering'", "description": "\"There was an offense and it is something for which Dustin apologized,\" the actress' rep told ET in a statement.", "site": {"identifier": "@etnow", "id": 23603092}, "creator": "Jackie Willis\u200d \u200d", "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20171107182913im_/http://www.etonline.com/meryl-streep-says-comments-made-about-dustin-hoffman-resurfaced-interview-are-not-accurate", "image": "https://web.archive.org/web/20171107182913im_/http://www.etonline.com/sites/default/files/styles/max_1280x720/public/images/2017-11/streep_hoffman_1280_8054848.jpg?itok=wog9ISZs"}, "description": "\"There was an offense and it is something for which Dustin apologized,\" the actress' rep told ET in a statement.", "msvalidate.01": "DC10472F438B55F3A58638BC31271706", "google-site-verification": "hKpIt34FKZ_qMU81xUdLUw2YzuyZY1pS76p0622Hc7w", "Generator": "Drupal 8 (https://www.drupal.org)", "MobileOptimized": "width", "HandheldFriendly": "true", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, minimum-scale=1.0"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": null, "source": "https://web.archive.org", "summary": ""}

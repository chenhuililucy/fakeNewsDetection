She claims he has yet to hand over any documents to back up his claim she \u201cfabricated the incident in an attempt to extort money from Phillippe.\u201d\n\nHewitt wants the court to sanction Ryan Phillippe for not turning over the text messages to the tune of $12,640 and for the court to order the actor to turn over all documents she has requested.\n\nAs The Blast first reported, Hewitt sued the actor for $1 million accusing him of assaulting her at his Los Angeles home. She claimed after an argument with the actor, she went to his house to get her belongings.\n\nOnce she arrived, she claimed Phillippe was extremely agitated, grabbed her upper arm \u201cso tightly that his grip left heavy bruises on her arm\u201d and then \u201cbraced his body and violently threw her down his staircase as hard as he could.\u201d\n\nThe lawsuit alleged the actor abused drugs like, \u201ccocaine, ecstasy, psychedelic mushrooms, and steroids.\u201d\n\nRyan Phillippe denied all allegations of assault and accused his ex-girlfriend of trying to extort him with false allegations.\n\nHe claimed to have only treated her with \u201ckindness and respect\u201d during their relationship and never physically harmed her.", "images": ["https://d3stcg8iy7fvse.cloudfront.net/2023/10/17062531/Erin-Andrews-Taylor-Swift-Travis-Kelce.jpg?aspect_ratio=390:219&width=390", "https://d3stcg8iy7fvse.cloudfront.net/2021/05/social_share.png", "https://d3stcg8iy7fvse.cloudfront.net/2021/06/theblast-logo.png", "https://d3stcg8iy7fvse.cloudfront.net/2023/02/Reese-Witherspoon-and-Ashton-Kutcher-scaled-e1675870552226.jpg?aspect_ratio=2:1&width=180", "https://d3stcg8iy7fvse.cloudfront.net/2023/10/17112113/Conor-McGregor-MMA-Return-scaled-e1697566890840.jpg?aspect_ratio=390:219&width=390", "https://d3stcg8iy7fvse.cloudfront.net/2022/03/EDDDF5A6-863F-4BA2-BE73-AD0D3E5FF86A-e1646274417838.jpeg?aspect_ratio=390:219&width=390", "https://d3stcg8iy7fvse.cloudfront.net/previous/b2aa0ec9f224ca01926b7f498162b67d.jpg?aspect_ratio=13:6&width=1300", "https://d3stcg8iy7fvse.cloudfront.net/2023/10/17115334/Aaron-Rodgers-1-scaled-e1697568831299.jpg?aspect_ratio=390:219&width=390", "https://d3stcg8iy7fvse.cloudfront.net/2022/04/MEGA851474_001-scaled-e1650997792945.jpg?aspect_ratio=390:219&width=390", "https://d3stcg8iy7fvse.cloudfront.net/2023/05/mega870469_080-scaled-e1684170411683.jpg?aspect_ratio=390:219&width=390", "https://d3stcg8iy7fvse.cloudfront.net/2023/04/The-Morning-Show-Reese-Witherspoon-and-Jennifer-Aniston-scaled-e1682919496197.jpeg?aspect_ratio=2:1&width=180", "https://d3stcg8iy7fvse.cloudfront.net/2023/03/mega938807_004-scaled-e1679689164293.jpg?aspect_ratio=2:1&width=180", "https://d3stcg8iy7fvse.cloudfront.net/2022/11/Maren-Morris-and-Ryan-Hurd-scaled-e1668351543261.jpg?aspect_ratio=390:219&width=390", "https://d3stcg8iy7fvse.cloudfront.net/2023/10/16172146/Pnk-Cancels-Shows-scaled-e1697502148923.jpg?aspect_ratio=390:219&width=390", "https://d3stcg8iy7fvse.cloudfront.net/2023/02/MEGA715082_009-scaled-e1675263256905.jpg?aspect_ratio=390:219&width=390", "https://d3stcg8iy7fvse.cloudfront.net/2022/12/Ethika-Underwear-Missing-Truck-Investigation-scaled-e1670792151817.jpg?aspect_ratio=390:219&width=390", "https://d3stcg8iy7fvse.cloudfront.net/2021/08/226593177_118848967135569_4446826477022717954_n-e1629737472841.jpg?aspect_ratio=2:1&width=180", "https://d3stcg8iy7fvse.cloudfront.net/2023/07/Reese-Witherspoon-Jim-Toth-1-scaled-e1689778395236.jpg?aspect_ratio=2:1&width=180"], "top_img": "https://d3stcg8iy7fvse.cloudfront.net/2021/05/social_share.png", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Theblast Staff"], "canonical_link": "https://theblast.com/52007/ryan-phillippe-reese-witherspoon-text-messages-lawsuit/", "title": "Ryan Phillippe\u2019s Ex-Girlfriend Demands $12k from Actor for Not Turning Over Reese Witherspoon Text Messages", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "robots": "index, follow, max-image-preview:large, max-snippet:-1, max-video-preview:-1", "og": {"locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "Ryan Phillippe's Ex-Girlfriend Demands $12k from Actor for Not Turning Over Reese Witherspoon Text Messages", "description": "Ryan Phillippe\u2018s ex-girlfriend is demanding a judge sanction the \u201cShooter\u201d star for dragging his feet about turning over all text messages with his ex-wife, Reese Witherspoon, regarding an alleged assault.

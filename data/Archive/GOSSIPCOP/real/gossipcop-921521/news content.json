dinner and refusing to leave the house to avoid the bitterly cold weather, you can count your lucky stars you didn't receive the most terrifying of all makeovers.\n\nYesterday, Channing Tatum and Jenna Dewan Tatum took to social media to share some rather creepy (okay, slightly cute) photos of their 'Sunday Funday' with four-year-old daughter, Everly.\n\nThe Magic Mike star posted a photo with his wife in which the pair showcase some rather questionable face art done by their daughter.\n\n'This is what it looks like when a little tyrant fairy artist holds you down and makes your face look \"better\",' Tatum captioned the post.\n\nAnd yes, that is a monocle on Channing's eye.\n\nMeanwile, Jenna took to Instagram stories to share several images of their family day at home.\n\nInstagram\n\nIn one clip, Channing can be seen playing with his daughter in the pool before falling sleep on the sofa, much to his artistic daughter's enjoyment.\n\nInstagram\n\nThe 37-year-old dancer also shared her own face painting project with her fans.\n\nInstagram\n\nWho needs a make-up artist when you have a four-year-old daughter armed with a paintbrush, right?\n\nRelated

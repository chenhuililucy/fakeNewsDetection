Even 'young actor' sounds better. You're already in a box. But they put you in a smaller box inside that box. It also implies past tense. It implies you've already failed, right? I was actually na\u00efve enough to think that people wouldn't think of it in that way.\"\n\n\u2018RIVERDALE\u2019 STAR SLAMS FAN FOR INAPPROPRIATE INTERACTION AND TWITTER RANT\n\nSprouse and his twin brother, Cole, had their own show on the Disney Channel from 2005 to 2011. The brothers also appeared in movies, such as \"Big Daddy\" when they were young.\n\nSince leaving the Disney Channel at age 18, Sprouse attended New York University and worked in a restaurant in New York City. He explained he and his brother left because Disney was not willing to work with the brothers on the show\u2019s direction.\n\n\"I mean, we had a really awesome idea for where the show needed to go. We were 18,\" Sprouse said. \"If that isn't old enough to know exactly what the show needs, then well, I would beg to disagree.\n\n\"I don't think [Disney] were willing to work with us, really ever. So we stopped the show,\u201d Sprouse added.\n\nSprouse, 25, has returned to acting and is in the middle of filming \u201cBanana Split.\u201d He also is opening a brewery soon. Cole Sprouse is currently a main cast member on the hit CW show \u201cRiverdale.\u201d", "images": ["https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2022/11/NEWSLETTER_ENT-532x120.png", "https://a57.foxnews.com/cf-images.us-east-1.prod.boltdns.net/v1/static/694940094001/56f75766-2ae6-46f0-8b36-d4ec08d4f346/6e61e3c8-3df5-4d18-80b9-c31a935bdf97/1280x720/match/348/196/image.jpg?ve=1&tl=1", "https://a57.foxnews.com/static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2023/10/348/196/maren-morris-divorce-ryan-hurd.jpg?ve=1&tl=1", "https://a57.foxnews.com/static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2023/10/348/196/roseanne.jpg?ve=1&tl=1", "https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2018/09/dylan-sprouse-splash-news1.jpg", "https://a57.foxnews.com/static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2018/09/1200/675/dylan-and-cole-sprouse-660-reuters.jpg?ve=1&tl=1", "https://a57.foxnews.com/cf-images.us-east-1.prod.boltdns.net/v1/static/694940094001/9765f6fe-3ab3-4829-95e4-e1c5ae9a2dd1/d34b1dee-e0be-414f-98b4-53783e2e3172/1280x720/match/348/196/image.jpg?ve=1&tl=1", "https://a57.foxnews.com/cf-images.us-east-1.prod.boltdns.net/v1/static/694940094001/271ebf0b-eced-4c50-803a-4cc67ddbda1e/27ef136b-1144-449c-8b9f-643d36adbbe8/1280x720/match/348/196/image.jpg?ve=1&tl=1", "https://a57.foxnews.com/static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2018/09/1200/675/dylan-sprouse-splash-news1.jpg?ve=1&tl=1", "https://a57.foxnews.com/static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2023/10/348/196/Getty_GraceKelly_CaryGrant.jpg?ve=1&tl=1"], "top_img": "https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2018/09/dylan-sprouse-splash-news1.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Kathleen Joyce"], "canonical_link": "https://www.foxnews.com/entertainment/dylan-sprouse-on-being-called-a-former-child-actor-that-term-is-so-derogatory", "title": "Dylan Sprouse on being called a former child actor: 'That term is so derogatory'", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, minimum-scale=1.0, initial-scale=1.0", "msapplication-square70x70logo": "//static.foxnews.com/static/orion/styles/img/fox-news/favicons/mstile-70x70.png", "msapplication-square150x150logo": "//static.foxnews.com/static/orion/styles/img/fox-news/favicons/mstile-150x150.png", "msapplication-square310x310logo": "//static.foxnews.com/static/orion/styles/img/fox-news/favicons/mstile-310x310.png", "msapplication-wide310x150logo": "//static.foxnews.com/static/orion/styles/img/fox-news/favicons/mstile-310x150.png", "description": "Dylan Sprouse said being called a former child actor was insulting.", "prism.channel": "fnc", "prism.section": "entertainment", "prism.aggregationType": "subsection", "pagetype": "article", "content-creator": "tiger", "dc.creator": "Kathleen Joyce", "dc.title": "Dylan Sprouse on being called a former child actor: 'That term is so derogatory'", "dcterms.abstract": "Dylan Sprouse said being called a former child actor was insulting.", "dc.type": "Text.Article", "dc.description": "Dylan Sprouse said being called a former child actor was insulting.", "dc.language": "en-US", "dc.publisher": "Fox News", "dc.format": "text/html", "dc.identifier": "urn:uri:base64:611039d3-5b2e-5bca-bb43-72ba24e0fd9e", "dc.source": "Fox News", "dc.date": "2017-12-29", "dcterms.created": "2017-12-29T11:42:05-05:00", "dcterms.modified": "2017-12-29T13:39:40-05:00", "og": {"title": "Dylan Sprouse on being called a former child actor: 'That term is so derogatory'", "description": "Dylan Sprouse said being called a former child actor was insulting.", "type": "article", "image": "https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2018/09/dylan-sprouse-splash-news1.jpg", "url": "https://www.foxnews.com/entertainment/dylan-sprouse-on-being-called-a-former-child-actor-that-term-is-so-derogatory", "site_name": "Fox News"}, "robots": "index, follow, max-image-preview:large, max-video-preview:-1", "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "site": "@foxnews", "title": "Dylan Sprouse on being called a former child actor: 'That term is so derogatory'", "description": "Dylan Sprouse said being called a former child actor was insulting.", "image": "https://a57.foxnews.com/static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2018/09/1024/512/dylan-sprouse-splash-news1.jpg?ve=1&tl=1", "url": "https://www.foxnews.com/entertainment/dylan-sprouse-on-being-called-a-former-child-actor-that-term-is-so-derogatory"}, "fb": {"app_id": 113186182048399}, "article": {"opinion": "false"}, "classification": "/FOX NEWS/ENTERTAINMENT/Celebrity News,/FOX NEWS/ENTERTAINMENT,/FOX NEWS/ENTERTAINMENT/Tv", "classification-isa": "celebrity,entertainment,tv", "classification-tags": "celebrity,entertainment,tv"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": null, "source": "https://www.foxnews.com", "summary": ""}

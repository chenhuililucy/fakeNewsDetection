She played Zoey Brooks on the Nickelodeon teen sitcom Zoey 101 (2005\u20132008) and its sequel film Zoey 102 (2023), and Noreen Fitzgibbons in the Netflix romantic drama series Sweet Magnolias (2020\u2013present). She is the younger sister of singer Britney Spears.\n\nBeginning in December 2007, Spears was subject to significant media attention and controversy after announcing her pregnancy at age 16. A misconception emerged that this canceled Zoey 101, however, the final season wrapped filming in September 2007 and premiered the following year. After giving birth in 2008, Spears stopped acting for five years.[2]\n\nSpears returned from her hiatus in 2013 and released her debut single \"How Could I Want More\" from her debut EP in country music, The Journey (2014). In 2015, Spears earned songwriting credits for Jana Kramer's certified Platinum single, \"I Got the Boy\", a song she wrote in 2011 during writing sessions in Nashville for her 2013 EP.[3]\n\nEarly life\n\nSpears was born in McComb, Mississippi,[4] and raised in Kentwood, Louisiana,[1] to James and Lynne Spears. Her older siblings are Bryan and Britney.[5] She attended Parklane Academy in McComb, where she was a cheerleader, and point guard of the basketball team.[6] She was enrolled in dance and voice lessons, and participated in school plays and church performances.[7] As a child, Spears and her family also spent time traveling and touring with Britney.[8]\n\nSpears studied with tutors while filming Zoey 101 in Los Angeles.[9] She finished her education via online correspondence[10] and received her GED in February 2008 through Tangipahoa Parish School System Adult Education Center.[11]\n\nCareer\n\n2002\u20132008: Career beginnings and success with All That and Zoey 101\n\nIn February 2002, at age 10, Spears made her acting debut in the Paramount Pictures drama film Crossroads which starred her sister, who portrayed the central character Lucy Wagner. Spears made a cameo, playing the younger version of Britney's character.[12] In April 2002, Spears walked the runway as a model for Kids R Us fashion show in New York City.[13] Following Crossroads, Nickelodeon cast Spears as a regular performer in the sketch comedy series All That for the 2002 season; she appeared on the show through 2004.[14] Spears portrayed various roles through the two seasons she appeared.[15] Along with the cast of All That, Spears also made appearances on Snick On-Air Dare, Nickelodeon's version of Fear Factor.[16] Deciding to pursue other roles on the network, Spears departed from the main cast on the tenth and final season of All That, and only appeared as a guest.\n\nIn August 2004, Spears signed a development deal with Nickelodeon in which she would star as the protagonist in her own scripted television series that would air on the network. The series went on to be titled Zoey 101 and Spears portrayed the role of Zoey Brooks. The series centered on Zoey and her friends who attend a fictional boarding school, Pacific Coast Academy (PCA). Spears recorded the series theme song, titled \"Follow Me\", which was written by her sister Britney Spears. Filmed at Pepperdine University in Malibu, California, the series premiered on January 9, 2005 and was the network's highest-rated series premiere in over eight years.

Nickelodeon issued a statement shortly after the announcement of Spears being pregnant at the age of 16, stating that the network respected Spears's decision to take responsibility and noting that its primary concern was for her well-being.[21][22] Spears' co-star Seann Flynn praised her as hard-working and talented, telling Nylon: \"One of the things that always stood out to me regarding her professionalism was how well she knew her lines. I don\u2019t think she ever messed one up. She always brought her best work to the table.\"[15]\n\nIn December 2007, Variety announced that Spears had signed on to guest-appear in the ABC comedy sitcom series Miss Guided, in which she played the role of the promiscuous high-school student Mandy Fener in the episode \"Hot Sub\" which aired on March 20, 2008. That same year, Spears voiced Goldilocks in the direct-to-DVD animation film Unstable Fables: Goldilocks & 3 Bears Show.

In subsequent years, Spears was rarely seen in the public eye and focused on family, saying: \"I used to be insecure at times, because I was always the youngest mom in the room. I quickly learned that being a good and competent mother has nothing to do with age.\"[65]\n\nSpears has been featured in several fashion blogs and magazines such as Nylon,[15] Seventeen, Teen Vogue, CosmoGirl, Teen People, Teen, Girls' Life, Mizz and Nickelodeon Magazine.[66][67] Spears has appeared in commercials and print ads throughout her career.

Aldridge, whom she had been dating for two years, was 18.[82] Spears confirmed her engagement to Aldridge in March 2008.[83] In May 2008, the couple moved to Liberty, Mississippi, and purchased a house, with Spears stating they would raise their child there.[84] She gave birth to their daughter Maddie Briann Aldridge on June 19, 2008, in McComb, Mississippi.[85][86][87] Spears and Aldridge ended their engagement in March 2009,[88][89] and Spears moved out in December 2009.[90] Spears and Aldridge reconciled in August 2010,[91] but ended their relationship a second time in November 2010.[92]\n\nThe announcement of Spears' pregnancy generated controversy, with criticism centering on the story purportedly glamorizing teenage pregnancy.[93][94] Some teens were disappointed with the contrast between Spears' on-screen personality as a \"good\" girl and her real-life teen pregnancy.[95] On June 4, 2008, while in Amite County, Mississippi, the Spears family filed a complaint against Edwin Merrino, a paparazzo who, they believed, was stalking the couple. Merrino denied the allegation. He was released later in the day after posting bond.[96] After her daughter's birth, Spears disappeared from the public eye for five years, focusing on raising her child.[97]\n\nMarriage and family\n\nShe subsequently began a relationship with Jamie Watson, a businessman who owns communications service Advanced Media Partners.

She was later airlifted to Children's Hospital of New Orleans, where she remained unconscious in a coma for two days. She woke up and was released from care on February 10.[103] Police reported the incident as occurring before 3:00 p.m. on a Sunday afternoon, and the sheriff explained that she was steering \"100 yards from her parents\" when she took \"a hard right to avoid running over a nearby drainage ditch\". The police report stated, \"The child was trapped and secured by the seatbelt and the ATV's safety netting. Within two minutes, Acadian Ambulance Services arrived and assisted in freeing the child from the cold waters.\"[104]\n\nIn 2020, Spears explained the situation further. She elaborated that she and her husband Jamie Watson \"[...] dove in and [...] were able to rescue her,\" then the first responder took her away. The firefighter was able to get a pulse, but her case looked \"grim at the time\", leading to her being airlifted to the hospital.[105][106]\n\nFeud with Britney Spears\n\nIn 2021, Jamie Lynn and her sister Britney were involved in a highly publicized feud via social media. Britney publicly accused Jamie Lynn of actively and knowingly being involved in her conservatorship, while not making any efforts to help her terminate it. Jamie Lynn denied the allegations and maintained that she was unaware of the details of the conservatorship. Britney threatened legal action against Jamie Lynn after the latter spoke extensively about Britney in both her book and the following promotional tour.[107]\n\nFilmography\n\nFilm\n\nTelevision\n\nDiscography\n\nExtended plays\n\nSingles\n\nOther appearances\n\nMusic videos\n\nAwards and nominations\n\nPublished works\n\nSpears, Jamie Lynn: Things I Should Have Said: Family, Fame, and Figuring it Out, Worthy Publishing, January 18, 2022.[131][132]", "images": ["https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:CentralAutoLogin/start?type=1x1", "https://en.wikipedia.org/static/images/footer/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/1/1b/Semi-protection-shackle.svg/20px-Semi-protection-shackle.svg.png", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/1f/Jamie_Lynn_Spears_2023_Interview_2.jpg/220px-Jamie_Lynn_Spears_2023_Interview_2.jpg", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/8/8a/OOjs_UI_icon_edit-ltr-progressive.svg/10px-OOjs_UI_icon_edit-ltr-progressive.svg.png", "https://en.wikipedia.org/static/images/icons/wikipedia.png", "https://en.wikipedia.org/static/images/footer/wikimedia-button.png", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/16/Jamie_Lynn_Spears_2011.png/150px-Jamie_Lynn_Spears_2011.png", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/76/Jamie_Lynn_Spears_Zoey_102_Trailer.png/150px-Jamie_Lynn_Spears_Zoey_102_Trailer.png", "https://en.wikipedia.org/static/images/mobile/copyright/wikipedia-wordmark-en.svg", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/4/4a/Commons-logo.svg/30px-Commons-logo.svg.png", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/1/1f/Jamie_Lynn_Spears_2023_Interview_2.jpg", "https://en.wikipedia.org/static/images/mobile/copyright/wikipedia-tagline-en.svg", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/9/96/Symbol_category_class.svg/16px-Symbol_category_class.svg.png", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/27/Jamie_Lynn_Spears_%26_daughter_on_Double_Dare.jpg/260px-Jamie_Lynn_Spears_%26_daughter_on_Double_Dare.jpg"], "top_img": "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/1/1f/Jamie_Lynn_Spears_2023_Interview_2.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": [], "canonical_link": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jamie_Lynn_Spears", "title": "Jamie Lynn Spears", "meta_data": {"generator": "MediaWiki 1.41.0-wmf.30", "referrer": "origin-when-cross-origin", "robots": "max-image-preview:standard", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "og": {"image": {"identifier": "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/1f/Jamie_Lynn_Spears_2023_Interview_2.jpg/640px-Jamie_Lynn_Spears_2023_Interview_2.jpg", "width": 640, "height": 903}, "title": "Jamie Lynn Spears - Wikipedia", "type": "website"}, "viewport": "width=1000"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": null, "source": "https://en.wikipedia.org", "summary": ""}

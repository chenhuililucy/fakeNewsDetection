In fact, the musical episode has a fine history of adding a little razzle dazzle to non-musical shows throughout the years \u2014 to both wonderful and disastrous effect.\n\nSometimes the format works, like in ABC\u2019s fairy tale fantasy Once Upon a Time episode \u201cThe Song in Your Heart\u201d (the network\u2019s The Middle will also break into song in an upcoming episode), and sometimes it doesn\u2019t, like the completely unnecessary late-season 7th Heaven episode.\n\nBelow, find a list of some of television\u2019s most notorious musical episodes from non-musical shows.

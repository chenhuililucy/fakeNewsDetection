Though the two have never been married, \"They\u2019ve just been together so long he\u2019s referred to her as his wife,\" says 2 Chainz rep Peter Kadin.\n\nThe 40-year-old rapper and entrepreneur shared a photo of his three children and Ward alongside Kim Kardashian West and Kanye West with children North and Saint in July 2017.", "images": ["https://www.usatoday.com/gcdn/-mm-/aa8f5b53932d0784d50fefe3f2f81bc08c84d744/c=0-270-3552-2277/local/-/media/2018/05/07/USATODAY/USATODAY/636613184717855399-GTY-955755302.jpg?width=3200&height=1809&fit=crop&format=pjpg&auto=webp", "https://www.usatoday.com/gcdn/-mm-/970d5f435eca8537f688321a3f2efb06f65ef3cc/c=0-100-600-700/local/-/media/2018/11/09/USATODAY/USATODAY/636773757289906023-areed.png?width=48&height=48&fit=crop&format=pjpg&auto=webp"], "top_img": "https://www.usatoday.com/gcdn/-mm-/aa8f5b53932d0784d50fefe3f2f81bc08c84d744/c=0-270-3552-2277/local/-/media/2018/05/07/USATODAY/USATODAY/636613184717855399-GTY-955755302.jpg?width=3200&height=1809&fit=crop&format=pjpg&auto=webp", "keywords": [], "authors": [], "canonical_link": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/life/entertainthis/2018/05/07/2-chainz-proposed-met-gala/588758002/", "title": "2 Chainz proposed at the Met Gala, and she said yes", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1,minimum-scale=1", "theme-color": "#0098FE", "og": {"title": "2 Chainz proposed at the Met Gala, and she said yes", "description": "The rapper got down on one knee on the steps of the Met Gala carpet and proposed to Kesha Ward with a massive ring.", "url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/life/entertainthis/2018/05/07/2-chainz-proposed-met-gala/588758002/", "site_name": "USA TODAY", "image": {"identifier": "https://www.usatoday.com/gcdn/-mm-/aa8f5b53932d0784d50fefe3f2f81bc08c84d744/c=0-270-3552-2277/local/-/media/2018/05/07/USATODAY/USATODAY/636613184717855399-GTY-955755302.jpg?width=3200&height=1809&fit=crop&format=pjpg&auto=webp", "width": 3200, "height": 1809}, "type": "article"}, "article": {"author": "Anika Reed", "content_tier": "free", "opinion": "false"}, "description": "The rapper got down on one knee on the steps of the Met Gala carpet and proposed to Kesha Ward with a massive ring.", "fb": {"pages": "13652355666,48958576760,156345381090801,110471702456365,6566864515,137698179626815,315942225236045,927427260614748,183850168300771,1443524575938047,251228454889939,158095147555989,115535341805950,236655713446291,1621466394844549,250325640686,177037772444433,1972936962947967,2047091012096533,535551216797440", "app_id": 215046668549694}, "ROBOTS": "NOODP, NOYDIR, max-image-preview:large", "google": "notranslate", "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "image": "https://www.usatoday.com/gcdn/-mm-/aa8f5b53932d0784d50fefe3f2f81bc08c84d744/c=0-270-3552-2277/local/-/media/2018/05/07/USATODAY/USATODAY/636613184717855399-GTY-955755302.jpg?width=1600&height=800&fit=crop&format=pjpg&auto=webp", "site": "@usatoday", "creator": "@usatoday", "title": "2 Chainz proposed at the Met Gala, and she said yes", "description": "The rapper got down on one knee on the steps of the Met Gala carpet and proposed to Kesha Ward with a massive ring."}}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1525622400.0, "source": "https://www.usatoday.com", "summary": ""}

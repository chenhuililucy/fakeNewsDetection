It was a really difficult time for me, as much for my wife and my family,\" he said \u201cTo be accused of something that I squarely did not do and to have the harsh judgment that followed and no way to counteract or do something in the moment to correct that was very difficult. It was frustrating. I just felt so powerless.\u201d\n\nThe allegations came to light in two YouTube videos uploaded by Ayissha Morgan, who appeared on the show three years ago. In the videos, titled \"The TRUTH about the show\" she outlined her experience, alleging \"Jack\" (a label she gave to the show's \"main person\") made several inappropriate, sexual comments.\n\nSchulman also said he was \u201coverwhelmed\u201d by the support he received from his fans and crew and urged that he lives within the values represented in \"Catfish,\" namely, honesty.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve lived a number of different lives in my 33 years. I\u2019ve experienced different things, I\u2019ve been in different social circles and I\u2019ve made mistakes. I\u2019ve been very honest about those and I\u2019ve been accountable, I\u2019ve apologized and done everything I could to make right where I may have wronged,\" he explained.\n\nSchulman also denied the allegations in an emailed statement to USA TODAY after the allegations were made.\n\n\u201cThe behavior described in this video did not happen and I\u2019m fortunate that there are a number of former colleagues who were present during this time period who are willing to speak up with the truth,\" he said. \"I have always been transparent about my life and would always take responsibility for my actions \u2013 but these claims are false.\u201d\n\n\"Catfish\" follows Schulman and co-host Max Joseph as they uncover the true identities of people's online love interests. Some end up being who they say they are, while others are \"catfish,\" or someone who poses as someone else.\n\nSchulman, 33, also serves as an executive producer on the show. He is married to Laura Perlongo. They have a daughter, Cleo James.\n\nMore:Suspension of 'Catfish' host Nev Schulman revives story about him punching a woman\n\nVideo:\"Catfish\" co-host talks season 2 and Manti Te'o", "images": ["https://www.usatoday.com/gcdn/-mm-/9850e0c9b56ed77075c9ca7090ddcaf7e07760ce/c=0-72-599-671/local/-/media/2018/12/11/USATODAY/USATODAY/636801428333177424-sara-Moniuszko.png?width=48&height=48&fit=crop&format=pjpg&auto=webp", "https://www.usatoday.com/gcdn/-mm-/29f2f187cb6627a41c2a37294493d7387da909a7/c=0-37-1686-990/local/-/media/2018/05/24/USATODAY/USATODAY/636627705093072509-AP-People-Catfish-Producer.jpg?width=1686&height=953&fit=crop&format=pjpg&auto=webp", "https://www.usatoday.com/gcdn/-mm-/29f2f187cb6627a41c2a37294493d7387da909a7/c=0-37-1686-990/local/-/media/2018/05/24/USATODAY/USATODAY/636627705093072509-AP-People-Catfish-Producer.jpg?width=660&height=374&fit=crop&format=pjpg&auto=webp"], "top_img": "https://www.usatoday.com/gcdn/-mm-/29f2f187cb6627a41c2a37294493d7387da909a7/c=0-37-1686-990/local/-/media/2018/05/24/USATODAY/USATODAY/636627705093072509-AP-People-Catfish-Producer.jpg?width=1686&height=953&fit=crop&format=pjpg&auto=webp", "keywords": [], "authors": [], "canonical_link": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/life/people/2018/07/11/catfish-host-nev-schulman-opens-up-cleared-sexual-misconduct-allegation/776234002/", "title": "'Catfish' host Nev Schulman gets candid about cleared sexual misconduct allegation", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1,minimum-scale=1", "theme-color": "#0098FE", "og": {"title": "'Catfish' host Nev Schulman gets candid about cleared sexual misconduct allegation", "description": "During an interview with People Wednesday, the host opened up about his experience with the investigation, saying he felt \"powerless.\"", "url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/life/people/2018/07/11/catfish-host-nev-schulman-opens-up-cleared-sexual-misconduct-allegation/776234002/", "site_name": "USA TODAY", "image": {"identifier": "https://www.usatoday.com/gcdn/-mm-/29f2f187cb6627a41c2a37294493d7387da909a7/c=0-37-1686-990/local/-/media/2018/05/24/USATODAY/USATODAY/636627705093072509-AP-People-Catfish-Producer.jpg?width=1686&height=953&fit=crop&format=pjpg&auto=webp", "width": 1686, "height": 953}, "type": "article"}, "article": {"author": "Sara M Moniuszko", "content_tier": "free", "opinion": "false"}, "description": "During an interview with People Wednesday, the host opened up about his experience with the investigation, saying he felt \"powerless.\"", "fb": {"pages": "13652355666,48958576760,156345381090801,110471702456365,6566864515,137698179626815,315942225236045,927427260614748,183850168300771,1443524575938047,251228454889939,158095147555989,115535341805950,236655713446291,1621466394844549,250325640686,177037772444433,1972936962947967,2047091012096533,535551216797440", "app_id": 215046668549694}, "ROBOTS": "NOODP, NOYDIR, max-image-preview:large", "google": "notranslate", "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "image": "https://www.usatoday.com/gcdn/-mm-/29f2f187cb6627a41c2a37294493d7387da909a7/c=0-37-1686-990/local/-/media/2018/05/24/USATODAY/USATODAY/636627705093072509-AP-People-Catfish-Producer.jpg?width=1600&height=800&fit=crop&format=pjpg&auto=webp", "site": "@usatoday", "creator": "@usatoday", "title": "'Catfish' host Nev Schulman gets candid about cleared sexual misconduct allegation", "description": "During an interview with People Wednesday, the host opened up about his experience with the investigation, saying he felt \"powerless.\""}}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1531238400.0, "source": "https://www.usatoday.com", "summary": ""}

This is all so new to me, and when we recorded this song a year ago, I never would have ever thought this was going to happen,\" Katelyn Brown said onstage when accepting the award with her husband. \"I just want to say, thank you so much to my amazing husband. I love you. This is so special that we get to share this together every night and I love you so much.\"\n\nWhile Brown Won the coveted Video of the Year, it was Jelly Roll who won all three categories he was nominated in: Male Video of the Year, Male Breakthrough Video of the Year, and CMT Digital-First Performance of the Year.\n\n\"They let a loser win tonight, baby. They let a loser win tonight,\" Jelly Roll told the audience when he won Male Breakthrough Video of the Year.\n\n\"This is more than an award. This is for the fans, baby. This is for the losers, baby,\" the \"Son of a Sinner\" singer continued. \"This is for the losers and the have-nots. God takes the impossible and makes it look small.\"\n\nBell Bottom Country belle, Lainey Wilson, went into the night with four nominations, the most of any artist, and she didn't walk away empty-handed. Wilson won two awards: One for Collaborative Video of the Year for \"wait in the truck\" with HARDY, and she also won Female Video of the Year for her hit song, \"Heart Like a Truck.\"\n\n\u201cMy heart is about to beat right out of my chest, I\u2019ll be honest with y\u2019all. This song right here is about finding freedom and strength,\u201d Wilson said during her acceptance speech for Female Video of the Year. \u201cIt\u2019s about not being afraid of the scratches and dents and bumps along the way. We all go a story to tell, y\u2019all.\u201d\n\nScroll through below to see a complete list of this year's winners, and for more CMT Music Awards, check out an extended cut of the show, featuring 30 extra minutes of new performances and bonus content, airing Thursday, April 6 at 8 p.m. E.T./P.T. on CMT.\n\n2023 CMT MUSIC AWARDS Nominations:\n\nVIDEO OF THE YEAR\n\nAshley McBryde, Caylee Hammack, Brandy Clark & Pillbox Patti - \u201cBonfire at Tina\u2019s\u201d\n\nBlake Shelton - \u201cNo Body\u201d\n\nCarrie Underwood - \u201cHate My Heart\u201d\n\nCody Johnson - \u201cHuman\u201d\n\nElle King feat.

Does 'no one' survive in the end of the show? So. Many. Questions.\n\nLast month, Turner was forced to deny theories her \u2018pack survives\u2019 tattoo indicated that her character Sansa Stark survives the GOT final season.\n\n\u2018It\u2019s just a quote from last season,\u2019 the newly-engaged star told James Corden during an appearance on The Late Late Show. \u2018Everyone figures that the pack really does survive, but it\u2019s just a moral that I like to live by.\u2019\n\nGetty Images\n\nOf course, this isn\u2019t the first tattoo Williams and Turner have got to commemorate their time on the show.\n\nBack in 2014, the pair got matching tattoos of the date they were both hired - 07.08.09 - to star in the hit television programme during a break in filming in Belfast.\n\nWe have a funny feeling this won\u2019t be the last GOT tat we see among the co-stars in the lead up the show\u2019s finale on HBO in 2019.", "images":

Hadid was said to be in the crowd during the set, and according to E! and Us Weekly, ended up spending time with him at the festival this weekend, kissing and being cuddly and coupley just like old times. But don't get it twisted\u2014they're just \"secretly seeing each other\" but not exclusively. The Weeknd also got PDAy with one of Justin Bieber's ex-girlfriends the next day.\n\nHadid and The Weeknd reportedly were seen \"kissing all night\" at the Kylie Cosmetics Coachella party Friday, E!'s source said. Us Weekly's source was a little more modest with the kissing description. \u201cThey were completely all over each other,\u201d the source prefaced. \"[They] kissed a couple of times.\"\n\nUs Weekly had a second source to spill more on the PDA: The two \u201cwere canoodling and being affectionate as she sat on his lap,\u201d the source said. \u201cThey are 100 percent back together.\u201d\n\n\n\nMore From ELLE\n\nE!'s source echoed this: \"They spent the whole night together and left together. Bella looked really happy. They were definitely super affectionate, cuddling each other while hanging out with their friends.\"\n\nE! additionally reported that Hadid and The Weeknd have been talking on and off the past couple months, actually, and that this has been building up. In November,The Weeknd was seen leaving Hadid\u2019s apartment in New York City, fresh off his October breakup with Gomez. That\u2019s likely around the time the chatting started.\n\n\"Bella never really lost feeling for Abel [Tesfaye, The Weeknd's real name] and had hope they would eventually get back together,\" the source told E!. (Hadid and The Weeknd broke up in November 2016, two months before he and Gomez started their 10-month relationship in January.) They\u2019re \"secretly seeing each other recently [but] are not official.\" This may be partly because, the source said, The Weeknd is \"playing the field\" and \"openly dating\" other women while Hadid \"wants to be exclusive.\"\n\nThis status update explains why The Weeknd was also spotted being affectionate with Bieber's ex Chantel Jeffries on Saturday. They were seen hugging, with Jeffries putting her head on The Weeknd\u2019s shoulder at one point, according to TMZ, which has photos.\n\nAt last year's Coachella, The Weeknd was spotted making out with then-girlfriend Gomez all over the festival grounds. Love interests change, but the Coachella PDA remains the same.", "images": ["https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/cardi-b-and-offset-attending-the-vanity-fair-oscar-party-news-photo-1694355966.jpg?crop=0.893xw:0.595xh;0.0417xw,0.0823xh&resize=360:*", "https://www.elle.com/_assets/design-tokens/fre/static/icons/social/facebook.a5a3a69.svg?primary=%2523ffffff&id=social-button-icon", "https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/gettyimages-1738323608-652d36a44c564.jpg?crop=0.829xw:1.00xh;0.0865xw,0&resize=360:*", "https://hips.hearstapps.com/vidthumb/images/elle-burn-ballads-babyface-ak-v1-65283d375ffe8.jpg?crop=1xw:1xh;center,top&resize=480:*", "https://www.elle.com/_assets/design-tokens/fre/static/icons/social/pinterest.e8cf655.svg?primary=%2523ffffff", "https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/bella-the-weeknd-1510762213.jpg?resize=640:*", "https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/kylie-jenner-and-timoth-c3-a9e-chalamet-are-seen-at-the-final-news-photo-1697549979.jpg?crop=0.595xw:1.00xh;0.204xw,0&resize=360:*", "https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/selena-gomez-gettyimages-1699488086-652d70db4a057.jpg?crop=0.668xw:1.00xh;0.160xw,0&resize=360:*", "https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/justin-bieber-and-hailey-bieber-attend-the-2021-met-gala-news-photo-1631970523.jpg?crop=0.771xw:1.00xh;0.115xw,0&resize=360:*", "https://hips.hearstapps.com/rover/profile_photos/67f50b99-742e-4e5d-8197-6e717b23ab3b.jpg?fill=1:1&resize=120:*", "https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/bella-the-weeknd-1510762213.jpg?crop=1.00xw:1.00xh;0,0&resize=1200:*", "https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/jake-bongiovi-and-british-actress-millie-bobby-brown-arrive-news-photo-1672425305.jpg?crop=0.571xw:0.800xh;0.151xw,0.0449xh&resize=360:*", "https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/frankie-grande-as-frank-n-furter-and-sister-ariana-grande-news-photo-1697392158.jpg?crop=0.825xw:0.580xh;0.0321xw,0.0169xh&resize=360:*", "https://www.elle.com/_assets/design-tokens/elle/static/images/logos/network-logo.242fea1.svg?primary=%2523ffffff", "https://hips.hearstapps.com/rover/profile_photos/67f50b99-742e-4e5d-8197-6e717b23ab3b.jpg?fill=1:1&resize=160:*", "https://www.elle.com/_assets/design-tokens/elle/static/images/logos/logo.2856426.svg?primary=navLogoColor", "https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/prince-harry-duke-of-sussex-and-meghan-duchess-of-sussex-news-photo-1697473263.jpg?crop=1.00xw:0.731xh;0,0.0152xh&resize=360:*", "https://www.elle.com/_assets/design-tokens/fre/static/icons/social/youtube.ce3e1ae.svg?primary=%2523ffffff&id=social-button-icon", "https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/chris-alba-img-9670-1676401473.jpg?crop=1.00xw:0.757xh;0,0.243xh&resize=360:*", "https://www.elle.com/_assets/design-tokens/fre/static/icons/social/twitter.c44156b.svg?primary=%2523ffffff&id=social-button-icon", "https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/priyanka-chopra-jonas-and-nick-jonas-pose-backstage-at-the-news-photo-1697387669.jpg?crop=0.934xw:0.706xh;0.0208xw,0.0508xh&resize=360:*", "https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/gettyimages-1738320717-652e96d803a19.jpg?crop=0.764xw:1.00xh;0.119xw,0&resize=360:*", "https://www.elle.com/_assets/design-tokens/fre/static/icons/social/instagram.f282b14.svg?primary=currentColor&id=link-out-embed", "https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/millie-bobby-brown-jake-bongiovi-gettyimages-1673812984-652d89c52f4e5.jpg?crop=1.00xw:0.668xh;0,0.0513xh&resize=360:*", "https://www.elle.com/_assets/design-tokens/fre/static/icons/social/instagram.f282b14.svg?primary=%2523ffffff&id=social-button-icon", "https://www.elle.com/_assets/design-tokens/elle/static/images/logos/logo.2856426.svg?primary=%2523ffffff", "https://www.elle.com/_assets/design-tokens/fre/static/icons/social/pinterest.e8cf655.svg?primary=%2523ffffff&id=social-button-icon"], "top_img": "https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/bella-the-weeknd-1510762213.jpg?crop=1.00xw:1.00xh;0,0&resize=1200:*", "keywords": [], "authors": [], "canonical_link": "https://www.elle.com/culture/celebrities/a19826987/bella-hadid-the-weeknd-kissing-at-coachella-abel-tesfaye-chantel-jeffries-pda/", "title": "Bella Hadid and The Weeknd Seen Kissing at Coachella, Secretly Dating Report", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "X-UA-Compatible": "IE=edge,chrom=1", "msapplication-tap-highlight": "no", "title": "Bella Hadid and The Weeknd Seen Kissing at Coachella, Secretly Dating Report - Abel Tesfaye Shows PDA With Justin Bieber Ex Chantel Jeffries", "description": "Bella Hadid ended up spending time with The Weeknd at Coachella, kissing and being cuddly and coupley just like old times.

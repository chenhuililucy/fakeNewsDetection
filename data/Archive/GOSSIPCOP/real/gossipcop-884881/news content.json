The creative director for Virtue Labs (launching in the UK later this month) used the brand\u2019s Moisture Defining Whip (\u00a334) which he blow-dried into Biel's hair. Incidentally, Abergel tells us this is his favourite product at the moment because it\u2019s extremely versatile and easy for people to use.\n\n\u201cYou can use it easily to air-dry or diffuse hair to enhance natural texture and bring out waves. I also like to use it on set to break up the hair after curling. I apply a golf-ball size amount into my hands and scrunch it into hair to enhance the style.\u201d\n\nHe then loosely tonged Biel\u2019s hair using the Ghd Platinum Styler, \u00a3165, \u201cto create these romantic waves\u201d that were soft and shiny.\n\nMake-up\n\nCelebrity make-up artist Kara Yoshimoto Bua payed homage to the same inspiration, creating a relaxed, glowy beauty look with blurred berry lips.\n\n\u201cInspired by the romantic white dress that she is wearing, I had a pre-Raphaelite feeling in the back of my mind and wanted to bring it forward to make it more fresh and elevated,\u201d she explained on Instagram, listing the exact Chanel make-up products she used on Biel. Take note:\n\nSkin\n\nFor Biel\u2019s complexion she used the Les Beiges Sheer Healthy Glow Moisturizing Tint in Medium, \u00a337, Vitalumiere Aqua Foundation in Beige 20, \u00a337, Les Beiges Healthy Glow Sheer Powder in N40, \u00a339, and the Powder Blush in 440 Quintessence, \u00a335. She also packed her off with blotting papers to slay any shine on the night.\n\nEyes and brows\n\nFor her eyebrows she used their Defining Longwear Eyebrow Pencil in 806 Blond Tendre, \u00a330, and on the eyelids the Multi-Effect Quadra Eyeshadow in 304 Mystere Et Intensite, \u00a344, and Le Volume de Chanel mascara, \u00a328, on the lashes.\n\nLips\n\nTo line Biel\u2019s lips the make-up artist used the Precision Lip Definer in Natural, \u00a320, then applied the Rouge Allure Liquid Powder in Avant-Gardist (available in the UK soon), showing Biel how to top it up with her fingertips for a soft blurred effect.\n\nAll the red-carpet fashion from the 2018 Emmys Open Gallery", "images":

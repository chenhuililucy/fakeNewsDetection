I don't want to have to meet somebody at 4 in the morning in a dark gym. I just want to go when I can go,' he added.\n\nRyan, if you need a hand in the gym \u2013 someone to compliment you at the pull-up bar, hold your towel, or even just stare at you \u2013 we might be free.\n\nRelated Story Ryan Reynolds Talks Cooking For Blake Lively\n\nRelated Story Blake Lively Reminds Us Why Ryan Reynolds Is A God", "images":

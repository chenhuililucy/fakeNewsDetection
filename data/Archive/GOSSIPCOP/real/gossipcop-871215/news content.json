So was The Real Housewives of New York City reunion host surprised when he heard that the couple has decided to call it quits?\n\nAfter reading the news on Twitter \u2014 just like everybody else \u2014 Andy reacted like so, as he recently told ET: \u201cI didn't not see it coming, but I didn\u2019t see it coming. You know what I mean?\u201d\n\n\n\nLuann announced that she and Tom had decided to divorce on Twitter last week. \"It's with great sadness that Tom & I agreed to divorce,\" she tweeted. \"We care for each other very much, hope you respect our privacy during this sad time!\"\n\nThe RHONY mom has since jetted off to Switzerland for some R&R, a move that Andy applauded. \u201cI spoke to her the day she was leaving the country,\u201d he told ET. \u201cYou know, I think she very wisely is leaving the country to kind of gather her thoughts and get it together. I think it\u2019s all happened in front of the cameras and, if you see the reunion, I think you'll be surprised, because you'll begin to see the first signs of cracks in the relationship at the first part of the reunion.\u201d\n\nYour browser does not support iframes.\n\nNow with the knowledge that Luann and Tom will eventually divorce, Andy teased that RHONY fans will view the upcoming sit-down in a whole different light. You can get a sneak peek of the reunion in the clip, above. \"The reunion takes on a new meaning when you know the ending of the story, frankly,\u201d he said. \u201cSo, it\u2019s interesting seeing it through that lens \u2026 I look forward to talking to Lu about where she's at as soon as I can.\u201d\n\nOf course, RHONY fans know that Tom caused a lot of drama among Luann and her Big Apple pals. So Andy said that he's interested to see how the couple's split affects this friend group moving forward. \u201cI think the wild thing is, she had just gotten all the other women in her corner and rooting for her,\u201d he shared. \u201cThat\u2019s what\u2019s also really sad about this, you know? Everybody was on her team.\u201d\n\nYes, Luann has gotten lots of love from everyone from Housewives to fans to even celebrities since she announced her breakup with Tom.

Sherwin is then forced to chase down his heart before it reveals how he feels to his crush.\n\n\u201cWhen we first started working on this film, we knew that we didn\u2019t want it to be preachy,\u201d the filmmakers previously told HuffPost. \u201cThere isn\u2019t even dialogue, so we never have the characters speak to persuade the audience of anything. We simply wanted to show the audience what growing up was like for us through this story about a sweet, red-headed boy who feels just as confused and scared about his feelings as we did. Hopefully, it\u2019ll resonate with those who identify with this character - and for those who don\u2019t, we hope they\u2019ll gain an understanding for people who go through this experience.\u201d", "images": ["https://pixel.quantserve.com/pixel/p-3aud4J6uA4Z6Y.gif", "https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6723616&c3=&c4=&c5=&c6=&c15=&cj=1", "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/597f62c815000021008b45be.png?ops=1200_630", "https://www.facebook.com/tr?id=1621685564716533&ev=PageView&noscript=1", "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/644805be260000610086a460.png?ops=100_100", "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/55a671a51900002500b865cb.jpeg?ops=scalefit_960_noupscale"], "top_img": "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/597f62c815000021008b45be.png?ops=1200_630", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Editorial Director", "Huffpost Personal"], "canonical_link": "https://www.huffpost.com/entry/in-a-heartbeat-animated-film_n_597f5615e4b02a4ebb771d36", "title": "Here's The Animated Gay Love Story We've Been Waiting For", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, minimum-scale=1.0", "description": "The absolutely beautiful \"In A Heartbeat\" brings the happy tears.", "keywords": "Arts and Entertainment,LGBTQ Sexuality,Queer Voices,Entertainment,Parents", "fb": {"app_id": 46744042133}, "og": {"title": "'In A Heartbeat' Is The Gay Animated Love Story We've Been Waiting For", "type": "article", "image": {"identifier": "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/597f62c815000021008b45be.png?ops=1200_630", "url": "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/597f62c815000021008b45be.png?ops=1200_630", "type": "image/png", "width": 1200, "height": 630}, "url": "https://www.huffpost.com/entry/in-a-heartbeat-animated-film_n_597f5615e4b02a4ebb771d36", "site_name": "HuffPost", "locale": "en_US", "description": "The absolutely beautiful \"In A Heartbeat\" brings the happy tears."}, "article": {"tag": "Arts and Entertainment,LGBTQ Sexuality,Queer Voices,Entertainment,Parents", "section": "Queer Voices", "published_time": "2017-07-31T17:12:37Z", "modified_time": "2017-07-31T17:12:37Z"}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "site": "@huffpostqueer", "title": "'In A Heartbeat' Is The Gay Animated Love Story We've Been Waiting For", "image": {"identifier": "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/597f62c815000021008b45be.png?ops=1200_630", "width": 1200, "height": 630}, "description": "The absolutely beautiful \"In A Heartbeat\" brings the happy tears."}, "al": {"ios": {"url": "huffpostnews:///?editionID=us&entryID=us_597f5615e4b02a4ebb771d36", "app_store_id": 306621789, "app_name": "HuffPost"}}, "robots": "max-snippet:-1,max-image-preview:large,max-video-preview:-1", "google-site-verification": "97Mj-wW7u8U1NOnkW1rfH-I1kgO0-a9YsgoesOk41R8"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1501521157.0, "source": "https://www.huffingtonpost.com", "summary": ""}

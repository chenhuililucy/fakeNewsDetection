{"url": "https://www.thetoptens.com/best-disney-channel-television-series/", "text": "The Top Ten\n\nWizards of Waverly Place Wizards of Waverly Place is an American fantasy teen sitcom which ran from October 12, 2007 to January 6, 2012 on Disney Channel. The series was created by Todd J. Greenwald, and stars Selena Gomez, David Henrie and Jake T. Austin as three wizard siblings with magical abilities competing to win sole custody of the family powers. Further main cast includes Jennifer Stone, Mar\u00eda Canals Barrera, and David DeLuise. Oh, I love this show. When I was younger, I wasn't allowed to watch it because of its magic elements. But now that I'm older, I've watched almost all of the seasons. This show actually has humor that makes me laugh. It's funny and charming.\n\n\n\nThe whole atmosphere, along with each interesting character, doesn't annoy me in the slightest. Okay, maybe a little, but that's nothing compared to most of Disney Channel's other shows.\n\n\n\nWhat I love most is Selena Gomez's acting. She portrayed Alex Russo perfectly - the sarcasm, the moments she has with her friends and family. I just love it. I still do, even as someone in high school transitioning into college. What I also appreciate about this show is the character development. Each character grows and changes as time goes on, learning from some of their mistakes and growing as a person. And they entertain me with their genuinely funny jokes along the way.\n\n\n\nI give this show an 8/10. It's worth watching, guys, even though it ...more I will really miss the show, especially the character Alex Russo, played by Selena Gomez. I will miss the whole atmosphere of waiting for a new episode. I expect to cry on the last episode. I wish I were BFFs with Selena because she is a great actor and singer, although I prefer her as an actor.\n\n\n\nI hope they make another movie.\n\n\n\nLove you, WOWP.\n\n\n\nYou were the best show ever.\n\n\n\nI really miss it and can't believe it's over. I can still remember watching the first episode and being gripped. I also remember not being able to say Waverly properly when I told my friends about the amazing show. I give Wizards of Waverly Place a B+. Its settings and magic make this feel like pure Disney. I do wish Even Stevens, The Famous Jett Jackson, Toon Disney cartoons (especially Gargoyles, Fillmore!, Lilo & Stitch: The Series and Darkwing Duck), Kim Possible and et cetera et cetera were extremely high on this list.\n\n\n\nI give The Suite Life of Zack & Cody franchise a C+. Sorry, but the characters are stereotypical. But the 2000s reminds me of my top-favorite looking destinations enough to recommend this.\n\n\n\nI give Good Luck Charlie a B-. Yes, it got more one-dimensional in the future like in Wizards of Waverly Place. But it was very realistic and finds ways to get its not-too-young demographic to relate to this show.\n\n\n\nI give That's So Raven an A+. That's So Raven/Epic has very three-dimensional characters. Its GBA games have extremely motivational music (after all, it is That's So Raven), even for GBA standards.\n\n\n\nI give Jessie an F. It is racist, stereotypical and ...more I LOVE the show Wizards of Waverly Place more than anything in the world! To this day, I watch it every single day. I'm literally watching it right now. I love all the characters. Every episode is fantastic, and Max is hilarious!\n\n\n\nI would LOVE for Wizards of Waverly Place to have another show, similar to how \"That's So Raven\" or \"Full House\" did. I am obsessed with this show in every way possible. My favorite episode is the last one because Max's lines were so funny. I was cracking up for weeks, like when he said, \"Alex, of course, I forgive you... any sister of Justin's is a sister of mine.\" Or when he said to Rootie Tootietootie, \"What do I know you from?\" Well, you get the point.\n\n\n\nI love, love, love this show, and I'm happy that it's number 1. Wizards of Waverly Place definitely deserves to be #1! Yay!\n\nThe Suite Life of Zack and Cody The Suite Life of Zack & Cody is an American sitcom created by Danny Kallis and Jim Geoghan. The series was first broadcast on Disney Channel on March 18, 2005, with 4 million viewers, making it the most successful premiere for Disney Channel in 2005. It was one of their first five shows available on the iTunes Store. The series was nominated for an Emmy Award three times and was nominated for a Nickelodeon Kids' Choice Award three times. The show was also a long-standing staple of the now defunct ABC Kids Saturday morning block on ABC. ...read more. This show was one of my favorites when I was a kid! I recently watched a few episodes late at night (yes, it does air on Disney Channel now, but at night, haha!), and I still laugh at their jokes to this day.\n\n\n\nWhat makes this show great is the fact that even though the characters can be stereotypical (like, London can be very annoying), they have their redeeming qualities that are highlighted well. For example, even though London is the typical rich, greedy child who complains all the time and gets what she wants, we are reminded later in the show several times why she is like that. She can be kind at times and is not ALWAYS who she comes off as. Plus, Zack and Cody are so charming, and their lives are always adventurous. The Suite Life of Zack and Cody is, in my opinion, the best show to ever air on Disney. The characters themselves are creative, funny, and unique in their own way, and make you laugh till your ribs hurt. The actors and actresses are some of the best to ever come out of Disney and are all successful. The storylines are great and original, and teach young children great life lessons about friendship, family, and relationships. The show also teaches children that they will get in trouble if they do something bad. I miss Zack and Cody so much, and I wish old Disney would come back. Good luck in college. Zack and Cody was my life! I miss it so much! I do love Wizards of Waverly Place, but Zack and Cody should be #1. It was the longest Disney Channel show ever and also has the most episodes. I miss watching Zack and Cody running around the hotel and seeing London and Maddie have a competition or fight and then make up. I even miss Mr. Moseby! I was so happy to see him return on Jessie (Debby's show that has now ended). I also was happy to see that every door had the Tipton hotel logo. And also when Mr. Moseby calls Cody! My point is, Zack and Cody was the best childhood TV show! I was born 4 months after the this show was made and did not grow up with it. But I learned about it and watched it. It is a very good show. It is very funny and very cute. I think Cody was very cute and skinny. I think this is better than some of the modern shows on Disney. I think Austin and Ally, Jessie, Liv and Maddie, Good Luck Charlie are good modern shows but K.C Undercover, dog with a blog. What a shame how stupid shows can be. Suite Life of Zack and Cody is a very good show that I like very much.\n\nGood Luck Charlie Good Luck Charlie is an American sitcom that originally aired on Disney Channel from April 4, 2010, to February 16, 2014. The series' creators, Phil Baker and Drew Vaupen, wanted to create a program that would appeal to entire families, not just children. This was another one of the only three or four good sitcoms on Disney Channel. It actually focuses on something called reality - like being a teenager and living in a middle-class, large family. Unlike most families depicted on TV, where they are completely flawless with perfect kids and no issues, this family actually faces financial problems and other troubles.\n\n\n\nThey don't focus on trivial issues, like not being able to sing for a few days or disliking a girl because her breath is bad (examples from Austin and Ally). Instead, they tackle real issues like being cheated on by a boy, or having a crush that you can't get over but are too shy to confront, or going through puberty. Overall, the show emphasizes two very good lessons: being a good example for your younger siblings and appreciating that family is an amazing thing. I think Good Luck Charlie is the last great show on the Disney Channel. It has a plot while keeping the storyline simple and funny. The characters are hilarious and sweet, and I find the show to be very relatable. It also leaves good overall messages for kids.\n\n\n\nFirst off, let's talk about the storyline. The protagonist, Teddy, records moments from her life into a collection of videos for Charlie, the second-youngest child in the family. Teddy covers the family's relatable conflicts, her own personal problems, her secrets, and the daily happenings. She offers advice to Charlie for her future self, and I find that endearing. The whole family is sweet and funny, and they all grow as characters - especially Gabe, in my opinion. Good Luck Charlie is definitely a great show and is enjoyable for a wide range of ages! I'm so happy that Good Luck Charlie is leagues higher than Austin and Ally. Unlike Austin and Ally, this is the most thoughtful sitcom ever that changes the lives of its viewers. The best part: laugh tracks are not misused, but rather used after all of the real family jokes. I literally burst into laughter when I saw Bob's legendary catch of Charlie in the first episode of Season 1.\n\n\n\nFurthermore, Teddy's video diaries teach such valuable life lessons on friendship and bullying. Unlike modern family-centered sitcoms like Dog With a Blog, where the parents endorse a negligent attitude, the parents in Good Luck Charlie are the opposite. Amy and Bob actually care about their kids, and the sitcom focuses on normal family matters.\n\n\n\nYou definitely want to binge-watch this sitcom because it delivers a lot of serious yet positive messages. I sobbed when I saw the GLC finale in 2014. Fingers crossed for a potential GLC spinoff. This is a great show. Considering it was on in the era of Jessie and Austin & Ally makes me respect it more. Despite all the shows about fame and riches, Good Luck Charlie is a show about a family. Just a family. Sure, this family gets into weird, unrealistic situations, but that makes it all the funnier.\n\n\n\nI personally love Gabe and Amy the most, but there is really no \"weak\" character in this show. So if you haven't seen it, do yourself a favor and get Netflix and watch it. It is just that good. This show deserves to be higher than Suite Life of Zack and Cody. And it definitely deserves to be higher than WoWP.\n\nGravity Falls Gravity Falls is an American animated television series produced by Disney Television Animation that first aired on Disney Channel, and then on Disney XD from June 15, 2012 to February 15, 2016. The series follows the adventures of Dipper Pines and his twin sister Mabel in the fictional town of Gravity Falls, Oregon, while on summer vacation. This show is one of the best Disney Channel shows I've seen in years. Personally, I think even Phineas and Ferb can't beat it.\n\n\n\nThe best part is the cast of characters. Dipper is logical, Mabel is eccentric, and Grunkle Stan (short for Great Uncle Stan) is a scam artist but still warm-hearted. Soos is the strange but funny maintenance guy at Stan's Mystery Shack, and Wendy is the chill and awesome teenage girl who also works at the Mystery Shack.\n\n\n\nThis show provides many funny moments for people of all ages. Whether it's Mabel eating hallucinogenic candy or gnomes barfing rainbows on your screen, there's something for everyone. \"Gravity Falls\" deserves so much better! This is probably one of the smartest cartoons out there and it gives the Disney Channel a bit of a darker edge, appealing to older kids. The characters are really good, and the voice acting is excellent. One of the villains, Gideon Gleeful, has to be one of the best characters on the show, second only to Mabel.\n\n\n\nGideon is edgy, original, and adorable. You might think that most villains would be ugly, but Gideon uses his looks to get his way, despite being only nine years old. Plus, his schemes to achieve his goals are pretty original. He doesn't resort to murder. Instead, he steals, manipulates, and even uses love. The only downside is that he hasn't yet used hypnosis. But \"Gravity Falls\" is definitely one of the best shows on Disney today! How are all these shows like Jessie, Ant Farm, and Good Luck Charlie rated higher than this? This show is one of the best things to come to Disney Channel. The story isn't bad, there isn't a laugh track playing every second, and the characters actually have personalities. They don't resort to cheap jokes every minute. We also can't forget the amazing animation style, voice acting, and mysteries for the fans to solve. This show should be number one. I'm starting to think that the majority of people who voted for the shows at the top were quite young. If they were, I can understand why they would like those shows. But if not, they should know better. This has the potential to be one of the greatest cartoons of all time. At first, the show seems directed towards a younger audience, but there is so much depth and symbolism that it's ridiculous. If you actually take the time to go through the episodes in order, you can see how well-developed the characters are. You'll also understand how the symbols and hidden messages are connected with one another and the plot of the story itself.\n\n\n\nThe show needs more time on Disney to actually attract a large audience like other shows, but it's already getting some 4 million views per episode and is gaining popularity fast. Gravity Falls will be one of the greatest Disney shows.\n\nThat's So Raven That's So Raven is an American supernatural teen sitcom television series. It debuted on the Disney Channel on January 17, 2003, and ended its run on November 10, 2007. The show had a spin-off series, Cory in the House. The series was nominated in 2005 and 2007 for Emmy Awards for Outstanding Children's Programming. ...read more. By far, this is the best show that Disney has ever made. The stories of each episode were well thought out and constructed perfectly. Raven totally encapsulates me as a person, and I'm sure countless others feel the same way. I really love how this show displayed integrity but at the same time depicted such hilarious situations, which were much appreciated.\n\n\n\nThis show definitely put me on the verge of crying my eyes out due to the sensational comedy acting given off by the actors, especially Raven. There will definitely not be a show like this on Disney again. That's So Raven was one of a kind, and I'm glad and grateful to have come across such a show. I'm literally in awe of this show. The talents the actors possess are remarkable and need to be commended. Best show ever!\n\n\n\nThis show had such good morals. For example, the episode where they put Raven's head on another body in a magazine because she wasn't skinny enough showed people that being a size 2 is okay. The way Raven told off the editor of the magazine was amazing. She showed that there is beauty in all sizes. Not to mention, this plot was so relatable! We all get insecure because of our size, but we then somehow find the strength, just like Raven did in this episode.\n\n\n\nAlso, other plots in the show were very relatable. Take, for instance, the plot where Sydney was doing drugs, or the one where they all had junk food for lunch. Granted, some plots were outrageous, but the moral was still there.\n\n\n\nThis show didn't have to come up with a new song every week because it didn't need to. The writing and acting were amazing and could carry the show from start to finish.\n\n\n\nThis was one of the best Disney shows that Disney has ever produced. That's So Raven was probably my favorite Disney Channel show growing up. It had humor, heart, drama, and all that other good stuff. The characters were real, and the acting didn't feel fake or forced. The show taught kids important things like the dangers of smoking, racism, body image, healthy eating, shoplifting, and family values.\n\n\n\nNowadays, kids' shows feature characters who are whiny, self-centered, and vain. Watching old episodes of That's So Raven today, I still laugh my ass off! It had \"wacky\" situations without being tacky or annoying, unlike most kids' shows these days. That's So Raven was and still is loved by both kids and adults to this day. I love That's So Raven! Out of all the old Disney Channel shows, this is the best. It has a lot of humor and heart, which is something I really like about the show. The show can also teach you important life lessons. For example, in episode nine, there is this mean girl who purposely throws her party on the same day as Raven's party so no one will go to hers.\n\n\n\nRaven has the chance to get revenge on her, but if she did, it would make her look just as bad as the mean girl. The lesson is: just because someone is mean to you, don't be mean to them. Anyway, even though the show got canceled after many years, we will always remember it, and the show will go down in entertainment history!\n\nKim Possible Kim Possible is an American animated children's television series created by Bob Schooley and Mark McCorkle for Disney Channel. What is so good about this show is that it is unique. The styles and themes are inspirational and modern, yet distinctive from other shows. Additionally, the episodes are usually well-written, full of fantastic, interesting missions and comedic moments and gags. For example, when Ron loses his pants. Kim Possible is a fantastic role model, and for anyone who hasn't seen it, I highly recommend it! It's very enjoyable, and the theme song with the memorable ringtone is iconic. The villains, such as Dr. Drakken, Shego, Camilla, and Professor Dementor, are fantastic. Such a good show! Kim Possible needs to be in the top 10! It aired for so long and was such a fantastic show! I'm completely shocked to see that people love Good Luck Charlie and Jessie so much. Those shows aren't even good. Good Luck Charlie is pretty close to Life With Derek, except they try to make it funny by making nothing serious, and it's just awful. The same goes for Jessie, which is a billion times worse. I can't even stand watching Jessie. I guess people love Jessie so much because there aren't many good shows to compare it to. In fact, there are currently no good Disney shows at all, besides Gravity Falls. Warning: This show contains well-developed characters, original storylines, tons of humor, and awesome animation. It's not meant for those who live a boring lifestyle void of fun and enjoyment. Do not allow children to watch due to the danger that they might get hooked on this great show. There is also the risk that they might attempt to imitate Kim's butt-kicking talents, which include Olympic-level gymnastics and tumbling skills, knowing 16 styles of kung fu, skydiving, cliff climbing, grappling, and dodging energy comet-powered plasma blasts.\n\n\n\nOkay, now that that's over, in case there was any confusion, everything above was intended as huge compliments. Great show, great characters, great animation - well, you get the point. Kim does show her midriff most of the time through seasons 1-3, but other than that, it's the most awesome, most badical show ever on Disney. This list is stupid. Kim Possible is the best series in the world.\n\n\n\nDr. Drakken and Ron are my joint favorite characters in the series. They are both so funny and awesome. And of course, the main character, Kim Possible. Kim Possible is the most attractive woman in the world. She is amazingly beautiful and her beauty is unique. Her eyes, hair, and hairstyles are so hot and unique. Sometimes she is funny, sometimes she is so charismatic. Kim is my role model.\n\n\n\nBest show of all time. Kim Possible definitely deserves to be number 1. Rock on, Dr. Drakken and Ron!\n\nThe Suite Life On Deck The Suite Life on Deck is an American sitcom that aired on Disney Channel from September 26, 2008 to May 6, 2011. It is a sequel/spin-off of the Disney Channel Original Series The Suite Life of Zack & Cody. Now, I'm hesitant to say I like this more than the OG, and before you scream at me, let me explain. Both shows are amazing and are both creative, but there are three reasons why this show is better than the OG.\n\n\n\n1: The theme song - come on, you can't deny it's a head-bopper. While the original is a classic, this one is so much more catchy.\n\n2: Debby Ryan - this is a Disney Channel all-star. I'm not saying Ashley Tisdale is not good. She's amazing. I, too, was sad that she was replaced by Debby, but come on, it was a great replacement.\n\n3: We see Zack and Cody older on this show. Throughout the original, we see Zack and Cody younger, and by the end, they were older but not for long enough. In this show, they are older and have jokes and act older, which is fun because people are funnier when they're older (they were funny when they were younger though). TSLOD is the only show where the jokes were perfectly timed. Furthermore, this was one of the only shows where the actors seemed genuine. Unlike today's Disney stars, Cole Sprouse, Dylan Sprouse, and Brenda Song were perfect for their roles.\n\n\n\nThis is because of the show's writers and directors, who understand comedy, timing, and a child's psyche. They were skilled. Now, Disney has really gone downhill, and to compensate for the lack of story and punchlines, they are adding other 'superpowers,' like in Lab Rats. Come on, Disney. All of the new Disney shows suck, like Shake It Up, Ant Farm, Austin and Ally, Jessie, Dog with a Blog, Liv and Maddie? They all stink. I don't know how anybody watches them. They are all so stupid, annoying, and boring. They aren't funny and usually make lame jokes. The old ones like Suite Life and WOWP are so good. Where did the good Disney shows go? The Suite Life was a funny, interesting show. I personally like On Deck better, but it's just so much better than these new shows. It was such a funny show. I can't believe it ended so sadly. I miss all of them so much. I grew up with this show, so in the end, I cried so hard. I especially love the smart Cody, playful Zack, funny Bailey, and dumb London. Thank you for the great show.\n\n\n\nThey should also make a continuation, like a college series or something like that, with all the previous characters. I'm sure it would attract many people.\n\nHannah Montana Hannah Montana, also known as Hannah Montana Forever for the fourth and final season, is an American musical comedy series created by Michael Poryes, Rich Correll, and Barry O'Brien which focused on Miley Stewart, a teenager living a double life as an average schoolgirl by day and a famous recording artist Hannah Montana by night. Hannah Montana was a big part of my childhood. Miley was the perfect idol for 10-year-old me, and I still love her with all my heart. This show has showcased the values of true friendship and family while simultaneously being entertaining. It made us laugh and cry, and I still consider it one of the best shows ever made.\n\n\n\nSeeing the evolution of the show from season one to four and watching the actors grow up is amazing. You know a show is spectacular if you look back at old scenes and they still make you cry. Hannah Montana is, without a doubt, the best show ever. I'm proud to say that I have been and always will be a Hannah Montana fan. What the heck! Number 9. Uh! NUMBER 9! Are you people CRAZY? It deserves to be #1 for sure. Nothing can compare to it: not That's So Raven, not Lizzie McGuire, no Jessie, not The Jonas Brothers, not Wizards of Waverly Place, not Suite Life of Zack and Cody or its stupid spin-off Suite Life on Deck, not Good Luck Charlie, not Gravity Falls, not Ant Farm, not Sonny with a Chance, not Boy Meets World, not Girl Meets World, not Liv and Maddie, not Shake It Up, not Kickin' It, not Dog with a Blog, not So Random, not Andi Mack, not So Weird, not Bunk'd, not K.C. Undercover, not Lab Rats, not Jett Jackson, not Dave the Barbarian, not Raven's Home, not Even Stevens, heck, not even Degrassi, iCarly, Victorious, Zoey 101, Big Time Rush, Drake and Josh, Sam and Cat, Ned's Declassified School Survival Guide, or any other dumb show that will ever come along. Hannah Montana will forever be the G.O.A.T. Miley is not known as the Disney Super Nova for no reason. She is the reason pop culture is the way it is today. She started it all, especially for shows like Wizards, Jonas, and Sonny. There's also a reason she is more famous than all other Disney stars: her show was the best and deserves the number one spot. Most shows have their ups and downs. I have watched every episode at least twice and still can't seem to find a downside to this show. It teaches real-life lessons, shows how to deal with real-life problems, and reflects on everyday life. This is the best show Disney Channel has ever had!\n\nPhineas and Ferb Phineas and Ferb is an American animated comedy-musical television series. Originally broadcast as a one-episode preview on August 17, 2007 and again previewed on September 28, 2007, the series officially premiered on February 1, 2008 and ended on June 12, 2015 on Disney Channel, and follows Phineas Flynn and his British stepbrother Ferb Fletcher on summer vacation. This should be first. I love Phineas and Ferb because their plot is brilliant, they're funny, and they rock. I don't watch anything other than Phineas and Ferb on Disney. The Disney TV shows are now all dumb sitcoms, and Phineas and Ferb isn't one of them.\n\n\n\nWhat I like about it is that anyone can watch it. For example, my 23-year-old brother loves Phineas and Ferb, and my 5-year-old cousin also loves the show. Another thing I appreciate is that they include 'adult' reference jokes, which attract an older audience as well. In my opinion, this show beats any other show on Disney. It's humorous and it inspires people to create anything they want. I love it! This show is by far the best that Disney has to offer. All other shows are very stupid in many ways (sorry, fans of other shows). Phineas and Ferb are not just clever. They're brilliant, and that's one of the things I love most about this show. Unlike other shows where characters, especially parents, are portrayed as dumb, Phineas and Ferb is different. The characters may be animated, but they feel much more human than characters in series with live actors.\n\n\n\nThe songs are wonderful and catchy. Phineas and Ferb teach us many important lessons, such as to seize the day, be creative, use your imagination, and be optimistic while never giving up. This show has changed my life for both good and bad. Yes, I'm a crazy fan, and that's why, for me, Phineas and Ferb is the best show on Disney. This should be first on the list! It's the best show Disney has ever had! Phineas and Ferb is so awesome. I love every single character on here! Everyone's personality is fantastic, and I absolutely love their songs and creativity. This is one show that's not afraid to be unique!\n\n\n\nI love Phineas's sweetness, Ferb's silence, Candace's craziness, Perry's mega-platypusness, and Doof's hilariousness. I also adore sweet little Isabella and the Fireside Girls, and of course, Baljeet and Buford. Major Monogram and Carl rock as well! Vanessa and Stacy are also awesome. I love all the agents, and they have never failed! This show must stay on Disney forever and ever! This show was great. In the first season, the show took a more comical approach. In seasons 2 and 3, it adopted a slightly more serious and mature tone. By season 4, it essentially transformed into a cartoon that totally breaks the fourth wall.\n\n\n\nSome people might think it's a bit ridiculous that the plot of each episode is exactly the same, but there are a few instances where it changes. For example, in Lights, Candace, Action!, Candace didn't try to bust Phineas and Ferb. Instead, she participated in what they were doing without saying a word to Mom. In Ready for the Bettys, Candace barely even cared about her brothers. Phineas and Ferb took Agent P's place, and Doofenshmirtz wasn't even a threat in this episode. In Toy to the World, Doofenshmirtz's plans didn't affect Phineas and Ferb's plan at all. In Get That Bigfoot Outa My Face!, Doofenshmirtz didn't have a plan at all. In Mom's Birthday, Candace didn't try to get her brothers in trouble. The list could go on ...more\n\nJessie Jessie is an American sitcom that originally aired on Disney Channel from September 30, 2011 to October 16, 2015. The series was created and executive produced by Pamela Eells O'Connell and stars Debby Ryan as Jessie Prescott, a small town Texas girl who moves to New York City to try to become an actress, but instead she becomes a nanny to a high-profile couple's four children: Emma Ross (Peyton List), Luke Ross (Cameron Boyce), Ravi Ross (Karan Brar), and Zuri Ross (Skai Jackson). 10 How is Jessie lower than Phineas and Ferb? Phineas and Ferb teaches kids the already debunked lesson that creativity should be limited, and the Phineas and Ferb plot is too repetitive. However, the plot in Jessie is varied. In fact, the serious and positive messages outweigh the negative ones.\n\n\n\nMost importantly, this show teaches viewers to have faith in themselves because their families certainly have their backs. It's another perfect example of a sitcom where laugh tracks are used after real jokes and not misused after fake ones. While some people believe that the acting is poor, this show teaches important leadership lessons on how to cope with critical situations, like when you are confronted with disrespectful people.\n\n\n\nThis show is as good as Good Luck Charlie. Cameron Boyce's death literally made me sob, and I wanted to binge-watch this creative idea for a sitcom in order to honor his legacy and pay respect. This should be higher up. I love \"Jessie!\" It has been my favorite show on the Disney Channel for the longest time. Most of the shows on Disney Channel are either not entertaining or ruined by the actors. However, this show has brilliant actors who have brought it to life! These actors have moved on to further shows because Jessie met the end of its plot and reached the maximum number of seasons. It even continued for an additional season because of the high ratings.\n\n\n\nThe show has an amazing storyline, and the actors portrayed the characters so well. The story is actually believable and was an amazing show while it lasted. I hope that one day, one of the other shows will be as impressive as this one. However, I would recommend: Austin and Ally, Liv and Maddie, Girl Meets World, Good Luck Charlie, Dog with a Blog, K.C. Undercover, Gravity Falls, Bunk'd, and Backstage! These haters should really go back and read some of the stuff they wrote because it's just ridiculous. I also love how they're stupid enough to put this show higher on the list than it would be by hating on it. My point is, Jessie is a great show, much better than the new Disney shows like Bizaardvark, Best Friends Whenever, and Bunk'd.\n\n\n\nI honestly don't know where people are coming from, calling it \"racist.\" It's a kid's show, for crying out loud. If it were \"racist,\" Disney wouldn't have it on the air in the first place. I've been watching for five years now and I highly recommend this program to anyone who hasn't seen it and likes fun storylines and laughs. JESSIE is the best Disney Channel show EVER! It's funny how Luke is always trying to get Jessie to date him but fails continuously. Emma is always talking about One Direction and fashion, Ravi is nerdy but polite, and Zuri is a sassy but sweet 10-year-old. Bertram is the sarcastic and lazy butler, and let's not forget about beautiful, creative, boyfriend-losing Jessie Prescott!\n\n\n\nI like that despite the utter craziness of the Ross kids, Jessie never quits. I think parents are just overprotective of their kids and take this show too seriously, forgetting that this show is make-believe. The characters are fake, made-up, and unreal, played by actors and actresses like Debby Ryan, Peyton List, Cameron Boyce, Skai Jackson, Karan Brar, and Kevin Chamberlin, who can all mostly act. It's OK for ages 5 and up and is better than Sam and Cat and My Little Pony. Thanks!\n\n\n\nSincerely, a Disney Channel, Cameron Boyce, Peyton List, and Zendaya fan!\n\nThe Newcomers\n\nKirby Buckets Teenage Kirby dreams of becoming a famous animator like his idol, Mac MacCallister. That may be why he is joined on his adventures by a variety of animated characters -- each with a distinctly vibrant personality -- which only he can see. Adventures take him all around his unusual town, Forest Hills, with best friends Fish and Eli. The threesome usually get into some predicament that they must escape before Kirby's crafty older sister, Dawn, and her whip-smart best friend, Belinda, catch them.\n\nThe Contenders\n\nAustin & Ally Austin & Ally is an American teen sitcom that premiered on Disney Channel on December 2, 2011, and ended on January 10, 2016. The series was created by Kevin Kopelow & Heath Seifert, the writers and producers of the Disney Channel sitcoms Sonny with a Chance and Jonas. 11 I freaking love this show! The characters, the plotline, the romance, everything! This show was my entire childhood; it taught me the importance of friendship and, of course, the importance of humbleness.\n\n\n\nEven though Austin was a mega-famous pop star, he didn't let it get to his head. He was humble and kind. A huge lesson we should all learn.\n\n\n\nAlly was my role model (and still is). She's so talented, and even though people underestimate her, she always proves them wrong. Her self-growth encouraged me to wiggle out of my shell and just... try my best and give it a go. She's exceptional, and in my opinion, the best role model Disney has ever shown.\n\n\n\nTrish and Dez are very underrated. They were both so hilarious and lovable. I don't get why they have so many haters. I love these guys.\n\n\n\nI'd never become the person I am today because, unlike most Disney Channel shows, this one was truly amazing. This deserves #1. Austin and Ally is my favorite Disney sitcom. I like all the characters for different reasons. Austin is a great character because he's famous and talented, but he doesn't let that get to his head. He's really funny.\n\n\n\nAlly has so much character development! She starts as the introverted songwriter and becomes more confident in herself later on. She's really cool, and I look up to her.\n\n\n\nI don't understand why so many people think Trish is ugly or that she isn't good at singing. That's wrong. She's amazing, and so funny, and really talented. It's amusing how she gets fired from all her jobs.\n\n\n\nDez is so funny! He's my favorite character because he's so randomly hilarious. His fashion sense is great too, haha. That's why I love Austin and Ally. The plot of every episode is amazing, and the songs are pretty good too. This should definitely be number one on the list. I must admit, I didn't like much of the music and Season 1. But then Season 2 came, and BAM! Don't Look Down, You Can Come To Me, I Think About You, Finally Me - it trended on Twitter! Austin & Ally is really one of the last good shows on Disney. There is so much character development.\n\n\n\nSomehow, this show also wound up on the top 10 WORST Disney Channel shows. One of the reasons cited was no character development, which I don't understand. Ally overcame her stage fright. There is supposed to be an arc in which Austin starts writing songs. Everyone (except Dez) is maturing just a little bit. It's not all rainbows and unicorns either - there is actually drama. And it has a purpose.\n\n\n\nIt doesn't seem like it in the first episode, but they actually work to get where they are. As unrealistic as it is to be an overnight sensation, the team has to work for it. Unlike on Shake It Up, it might just be me, but lately it seems like everything comes easy to them. On Jessie, I don't ...more I love Austin & Ally. It's so funny and entertaining. We have Austin, who is a teenager propelled to stardom after becoming an overnight internet sensation with the song Double Take. There's Ally, the brilliant and talented teenager who is restricted to only writing songs because of her paralyzing stage fright. Because of this, Ally eventually decides to become Austin's songwriter. Then there's Trish, the girl with a loud fashion sense and an attitude to match, who becomes Austin's manager. And Dez, the goofy and random redhead.\n\n\n\nThe cast all work so well together, and it's always entertaining.\n\nLizzie McGuire Elizabeth Brooke McGuire, famously known as Lizzie, is the main character in the show. She is portrayed as a caring, rational, and cooperative person, although her animated alter-ego displays her true feelings from time to time. 12 This show is fantastic! I absolutely admire this show because Lizzie relates to me a lot, and her cartoon alter ego is so funny! I also like the fashion and episodes because they're enjoyable, witty, bright, and relatable. It's a great show! I definitely recommend this show! How is Good Luck Charlie higher than this? When I think of Disney, I think of THIS SHOW. If there is one show where I think Disney got it absolutely right, it would be this show. The synopsis wasn't unrealistic. Lizzie behaved her age and acted like how any regular teenager would act. High school was like high school, and the show was both funny and charming. By far, this is Disney's best. Lizzie McGuire was the best show of all time. Hilary Duff is my role model and has been since I was a little kid. This was actually one of the few shows that actually taught and meant something. They need to bring back shows like this, with stars who still respect themselves like Hilary Duff did and does. She is one of the few childhood stars who grew up to not be a druggie or a \"sleaze.\" Best single-camera-shot show on Disney Channel. I know they did the same thing with Zeke & Luther and Kirby Buckets, but this breaks the record for Disney Channel's best sitcom without a laugh track. This should've been the best live-action Disney Channel show, while Gravity Falls is the best Disney Channel cartoon.\n\nStar vs. the Forces of Evil \"Star vs. the Forces of Evil\" is an American animated television comedy produced by Disney Television Animation for Disney XD. It was created by Daron Nefcy and developed by Jordana Arkin and Dave Wasson. The series follows teenage magical princess from the dimension of Mewni Star Butterfly and her teenage human roommate and best friend from Earth Marco Diaz as they live their daily lives, go on adventures in other dimensions, and try to prevent the forces of evil from stealing Star's magic wand. The first episode aired on January 18, 2015 on Disney Channel but its first season officially premiered on Disney XD on March 30, 2015 and ended on September 21, 2015. The second season premiered on ...read more. 13 How is this show, along with Gravity Falls, getting beaten by these crappy sitcoms?! This is one of Disney's best works, if not the best! The animation is wonderful, the energetic tone is zany and fun to watch, and the characters are likable and believable. The jokes may not be as funny as those in Gravity Falls, but they're still very memorable and good for a laugh. This show needs more love, certainly more than those horrible sitcoms! Star vs. the Forces of Evil is the best show ever! It changed my life forever, and I'm indebted to it. Without SVTFOE, I'd be lying in a ditch, waiting for my life to end. I'm so glad to be part of a fandom with so many amazing people! The comment below me is right. Star is super awesome. Some shows, like Sanjay and Craig, don't have a plot. They either A) include vomiting in every episode, or B) always do something nasty that leads to them getting canceled. This should be higher up on this list! It and Gravity Falls are bringing back Disney. Yet, old, painful sitcoms are still sitting up high on the list? This is one of the best shows!\n\nRecess Recess is an American animated television series created by Paul Germain and Joe Ansolabehere and produced by Walt Disney Television Animation, with animation done by Grimsaem, Plus One Animation, Sunwoo Animation, and Toon City. 14 I wish they still had the old generation of Disney Channel airing! I loved all those shows from my childhood, and it makes me pissed off that even Disney has gone into this garbage the media created. Surprisingly, this and Kim Possible are some of the only ones I remember watching all the time. Also, I just found out my favorite video game actress, Ashley Johnson, played Gretchen. Huh. Come on, guys! This was the best show ever made! Do you know any other shows where the main characters are best friends who, no matter what, stand up for what they believe in? TJ is my hero! I loved Recess. My heart was broken when they got rid of Disney Cinemagic because it meant that they would stop showing this and Kim Possible. I found all the characters really relatable too.\n\nSonny With a Chance Sonny with a Chance is an American sitcom created by Steve Marmel which aired for two seasons on Disney Channel from February 8, 2009 to January 2, 2011. The series follows the experiences of teenager Sonny Munroe, portrayed by Demi Lovato, who becomes the newest accepted cast member of her favorite live comedy television show, So Random!. 15 Sonny With a Chance is an awesome (maybe even the best) Disney Channel show for a couple of reasons. The cast is really talented. Demi Lovato played a happy, ambitious, positive character extremely well, even though she was really suffering at the time. Tiffany Thornton and Sterling Knight are really kind and sweet in real life, but when you see some of their scenes, you'll think they're jerks. Brandon Smith and Doug Brochu have excellent comedic timing (as does the whole cast) and make Nico and Grady best friends for life.\n\n\n\nAllisyn Arm perfectly captures Zora's quirk and weird charm. Sterling and Demi also have amazing chemistry that'll make you ship Channy for sure. The episodes are very funny but also have good lessons. Sonny is a great role model for kids as well. I'm upset that Sonny With a Chance isn't in the top ten. I think that this may be the best Disney Channel show to date. The characters are done very well. Sonny is a great role model, as she is kind and willing to give everyone a second chance. The acting is amazing.\n\n\n\nSome people think Chad is a jerk, but I really think he has a great character arc. I love how he becomes a better person for Sonny. The same goes for Tawnie. Honestly, this show should be #1. I love Demi Lovato. She's such a good singer and actress. The whole cast is funny. This is one of the few shows that doesn't have a fake background and cheesy, poorly-played actors. The shows must have taken time to produce, evident from how well the lines are written and portrayed. I really think this show deserves to be number 1! I loved it. It was just so great! Sonny was a role model, always trying to make things right when they went awry. I don't know why this is number 12. It was really funny and just a great show overall. The characters were so likable, and so was Demi Lovato. Best show on Disney Channel, I believe.\n\nPhil of the Future Phil of the Future is an American science fiction sitcom that originally aired on Disney Channel from June 18, 2004, to August 19, 2006, for two seasons. 16 I loved Phil of the Future. I could relate to it because I have an older brother. We always fight, and it seems like we hate each other, but he's my bro, so I love him! The show was really interesting and funny. It was the best show ever! Are you kidding me? Phil of the Future ranked below shows like Austin and Ally, ANT Farm, Dog with a Blog, and Shake it Up? Some 13-year-old girl must have created this list, I swear. People don't know real TV at all. How is Dog with a Blog above this. Phil of the Future is hands down the best Disney Channel show ever. Pim was the best, I loved her! Phil was hot and the show was just overall the most entertaining. Childhood memories! I wrote my 3rd-grade essay about it and got an 86%. I changed the names of Phil and Keeley and wrote about the first episode. Good thing the teacher never heard about that cartoon.\n\nLab Rats Lab Rats, also known as Lab Rats: Bionic Island for the fourth season, is an American television sitcom that premiered on February 27, 2012, on Disney XD, and aired through February 3, 2016. The series was created by Chris Peterson and Bryan Moore and produced by It's a Laugh Productions for Disney XD. 17 What I like about this show is that it actually has a plot. It features an antagonist, introducing at least one new one per season, as well as protagonists and good actors and actresses. The jokes are original and genuinely funny. The show also teaches morals, just like any other show, and I appreciate that the parents aren't portrayed as brainless or nonexistent. Lab Rats should be rated much higher. It's a big step forward for Disney. The show's plot, centered around bionics, thickens as the series progresses, and the fight scenes aren't cheesy. While there is the occasional clich\u00e9 or stereotype, compared to shows like Austin and Ally, you barely notice them. I can't believe Lab Rats is at 22. It should be within the top 5. It has a mix of thrill, action, comedy, and family problems that are so out of this world. I especially like the character Adam, played by Spencer Boldman. Spencer is doing a great job showing Adam's personality as a caring, sometimes mean, and funny brother.\n\n\n\nMy favorite character is Leo. He ties the whole family together. He is the little brother that no one believes but everyone cares for. He is the only kid in the Davenport family that doesn't have bionics, but he seems to hang on without them. Even though he wishes he had them, he has a great developing mind, which will probably lead to a great part of the next season or the end of the season. This show is awesome! Its characters act real and everyone has a personality. It addresses both people problems and hero problems. Every episode has an individual plot, but there is also an overarching plot. There are actual dangerous villains who also have personality and aren't just people doing evil stuff because the show needs a plot.\n\n\n\nIt's actually very real. Not every bad person is brought to justice, and some bad things happen to good, innocent people. There are very few characters that I don't enjoy on screen. Very few clich\u00e9s are ever used, which is great. I could go on and on about every aspect of the show, but if you haven't seen it, then you are living under a rock. Watch it. You'll be happy you did! Lab Rats is an amazing show! There is lots of suspense, mystery, and exciting fighting scenes. I like how at the beginning their bionics are a secret, then later the whole world knows about it. This gives them lots of problems, but they overcome them as a family. I also love how funny Adam is in the show. Even in the most tense situations, he always makes a joke.\n\n\n\nLab Rats then continues into Lab Rats: Bionic Island and then combines with Mighty Med to create Lab Rats: Elite Force. If you haven't seen the show, you really should!\n\nLiv and Maddie Liv and Maddie is a live-action Disney Channel sitcom that started on July 19, 2013, and ended on March 24, 2017. It is about two identical twin sisters named Olivia \"Liv\" Rooney and Madison \"Maddie\" Rooney (both portrayed by actress Dove Olivia Cameron; born in January 1996 as Chloe Celeste Hosterman) who reunite after one of them, Liv, returns to her home to see her family after four years of starring on a hit musical sitcom entitled \"Sing It Loud!\". The show is both a comedy and a drama, and is intended for viewers of all ages. In total it has had four complete seasons and its fourth and final season started on September 23, 2016. 18 I love Liv and Maddie! I don't just like their shows, but I also love Liv's songs, especially You and Me and the Beat. I love Maddie's character. She never takes no for an answer and she won't give up on anything. I love how Liv and Maddie have a connection with each other.\n\n\n\nParker makes me laugh. He will take any challenge. Joey also makes me laugh. He will do anything to get a girl. There is one more person that I want to talk about. Willow makes me laugh. She is a good friend to Maddie but she will do anything to go out with Joey. I really enjoy Liv and Maddie. It's done differently than other Disney Channel shows. For example, I like how they talk to the camera to clarify things and show the point of view from the speaker. This allows viewers to become emotionally attached to the show. The only minor issue I have is that when Liv is happy, her voice becomes irritating, making it hard to focus on the actual problem at hand. Overall, Liv and Maddie is a well-done and enjoyable show to watch when I'm bored. 14...14? This show excels in story/plot, characters, character development, jokes, soundtrack, emotion, and messages. The best T.V. show of all time. Let me elaborate:\n\n\n\nPlot: The plot is about identical twin sisters with opposing personalities who are best friends. They stick together through thick and thin. This show is also about the importance of family and friendship. In every episode, there is a lesson about life. No matter what they go through, they always make it out together.\n\n\n\nCharacters: Liv is the girly twin who is a former actress, and Maddie is the tomboy twin who plays basketball. Both roles are played by Dove Cameron, who has the personalities of both characters combined. She does the perfect job. Also in the twins' family are their brothers Joey and Parker, and parents Pete and Karen. Parker gets lots of great lines. He is the definition of \"deadpan snarker\". The mother Karen is very funny as well. She was especially funny in the episode ...more I loved this show as a kid so much. I remember downloading it all on Sky Go years ago and just rewatching it all. I could never get bored of it. Finding out that Liv and Maddie were in fact the same person was such a moment. Respect to Dove Cameron for having to act in two roles. I honestly still love Dove Cameron, and I know she doesn't want to talk about her Disney Channel times as it was a hard time for her. So, I'm excited to see the new and grown-up Dove Cameron.\n\nShake It Up Shake It Up (sometimes stylized as Shake It Up!) is an American sitcom that originally aired on Disney Channel in the United States from November 7, 2010 to November 10, 2013. Created by Chris Thompson and starring Bella Thorne and Zendaya, the show follows the adventures of CeCe Jones (Bella Thorne) and Rocky Blue (Zendaya) as they star as background dancers on a local show, Shake It Up Chicago. It also chronicles their misadventures on and off-set and their troubles and rising social status at school. 19 It's like the best thing that happened to Disney. The reason why I find this show interesting is because the cast members are dedicated to the show. Zendaya and Bella work really hard. They have to remember lines, learn new choreography for every show, and manage their music careers, school, interviews, and movie roles. Shake It Up is the best Disney Channel show ever. I'm so mad they're having the series finale. A season finale would be okay. It is an awesome show. I love the dancing in Shake It Up, as well as the Tokyo, Japan episode. Shake It Up should be number one. There should be some way that Shake It Up doesn't have a series finale. Shake It Up is the best show in the history, present, and future of television. The actors on the show are amazingly talented, and the writers are geniuses. Everyone who works on that show is a legend. It excels in every single way, and I can proudly say it is my favorite TV show of all time. I will praise Shake It Up in a moment, but first I wanted to talk about some of the other Disney Channel shows. I'm a little older and I'm not saying my opinion is more valuable, but I can say that I've watched many of the new and older shows. I wanted to say that That's So Raven, Lizzie McGuire, Even Stevens (and possibly Kim Possible) are some of the best shows Disney Channel has ever had. That's So Raven episodes can make anyone crack up and Hilary Duff's success outside of Disney really paved the way for other female artists like Miley, Selena, and Demi. At least some of those older shows ranked decently. That's So Raven #5!\n\n\n\nI had pretty much gave up on Disney Channel and watched very little of it from 2006-2011. I still liked to turn back to it and relive my childhood every once in a while. One day I come across this show called Shake It Up (the episode was \"Sweat It Up\") and I could not stop laughing. It was hilarious and I had to see more. And that isn't even one of ...more\n\nBoy Meets World Boy Meets World is an American coming-of-age sitcom created by Michael Jacobs and April Kelly that aired on ABC for seven seasons between September 1993 and May 2000. The series centers on Cory Matthews (Ben Savage) and his friends and family, as he progresses from childhood to adulthood. Episodes chronicle the everyday events of Cory's home and school life; his teacher and neighbor George Feeny (William Daniels) delivers life lessons as Cory learns to cope with social and personal issues of adolescence. Cory has strong relationships with his older brother Eric (Will Friedle), younger sister Morgan (Lily Nicksay), and parents, Amy (Betsy Randle) and Alan (William Russ). Cory's friendship with ...read more. 20 It's sad to know that Boy Meets World isn't at least in the top 5. A lot of kids nowadays have never even heard of this show and honestly heartbreaking to hear. BMW is probably one of my favorite shows ever. It was actually focused on the importance of love, life, family and friendship, not going to high school at 11, having magical powers or becoming famous... I feel like a lot of kids and families can relate to what happened in every episode. Also, the jokes weren't overused and cocky, like in most of the shows now. How is Boy Meets World not number 1? All the shows now are very overrated and stupid. Boy Meets World actually teaches lessons. All the characters were realistic, and each of them had realistic lives. The parents in TV shows now are literally dumb on purpose for entertainment. No, the parents in Boy Meets World were realistic and treated their kids fairly and knew what was right for their kids. Also, this show was so hilarious (Eric, duh). Are you kidding me? Are you kidding me?! This show is #23? This is one of the best shows on television. It taught important life lessons, it was funny, and wasn't afraid to get a little real at times. Topanga and Cory are the bomb. Watch it on ABC Family. It is so much better than Girl Meets World, Austin and Ally, ANT Farm, Jessie, and all other dumb new shows combined. I love Boy Meets World! I didn't know it existed until Girl Meets World came onto Disney Channel. As soon as I heard about the show, they started doing reruns on Nick, so I have watched the whole series! I actually cried when the show was over! I'm just glad this show was recognized for how amazing it is. Girl Meets World can't even compare to how amazing of a show this is! I love you forever, Cory & Topanga!\n\nGirl Meets World Girl Meets World is an American coming of age television sitcom. The series made its debut on Disney Channel on June 27, 2014. 21 Girl Meets World should be higher up in fact it should be number 1. I know a lot of people hate it but it really affects some people and makes them a lot happier and make them a better person. It has helped me and my friend because at first we were down all the time and we weren't happy but the life lessons they teach are actually amazing and help a lot. They almost never have episodes that are copies of other shows and you don't see the same boring, lame, cheesy things you see in most kids shows. This show has changed my life it's seriously underrated and I love it and I wish I could tell Rowan, Sabrina, Corey, Peyton, Ben, Danielle, and August thank you so much. I hope the people who don't like it actually watch it and see how amazing and inspiring it is. I love it when Girl Meets World teaches so much not just about knowledge about life in general! The metaphors they make connects the lessons to the real life world which not only them as characters can understand but us as the audience can relate to. It is a beautifully constructed show and I'm sorry Lucaya all the way! The connection between the characters are so strong and the random flashbacks to Boy meet World is amazing. If you like Disney shows this is definitely not one that you should skip out on because Girl meets world makes life lessons entertaining and I think that anyone no matter what age will enjoy the show. This show is basically my life. I love it like no other. It's not just a show to me. It means a lot more. It has taught me many things and has been life-changing. I can relate a lot to the character of Riley. She's fun, quirky, annoying, and funny on the outside, but insecure, scared, and unpredictable on the inside. I can relate to every character, but mostly to Riley. Some episodes, such as GMRileytown, GMForgivenessProject, and GMAChristmasMaya, have made me cry a lot and drawn me deeper into the characters' stories. Just seeing the cast's faces brightens my day. I definitely want this show to be number one because it has had such a significant impact on me, made me a better person, and provided comfort in rough times. I currently watch only two shows on TV: Girl Meets World and Gravity Falls. The casting for Girl Meets World is absolutely amazing. Rowan Blanchard is perfect for the role of the quirky, adorable Riley Matthews, the daughter of Cory and Topanga. Sabrina Carpenter plays Maya Hart, who appears to be a troublemaker at first glance but has family problems, much like Shawn Hunter did. Let's not forget the adorable August Maturo, who plays Riley's little brother. This show is amazing because it educates the audience so much. Although some episodes are similar to episodes from Boy Meets World, I think it's important that they're reintroducing those ideas to this generation's kids.\n\nLilo & Stitch: The Series Lilo & Stitch: The Series is an American animated television series produced by Walt Disney Television. 22 Some of the shows above this are worse, such as Hannah Montana. Why is Hannah Montana above this and other older shows? It is funny, and I could watch it 10 times without getting slightly bored! Probably the best cartoon on the list. Some of the other cartoons, like Star vs. the Forces of Evil, are just weird. I used to watch the episodes online all the time in like 4th grade. This show was great.\n\nCory in the House Cory in the House is a television show, which aired on the Disney Channel from January 12, 2007, to September 12, 2008, and was a spin-off from the Disney show That's So Raven. 23 I remember when the pilot aired. My grandma was suffering through cancer. During one of her surgeries, she had a heart attack and a nosebleed. I thought she was a goner. Then, one of the nurses turned on the TV, and the character we know as Cory appeared. Just after, my grandma came back to life. Not only that, but her sore hip was better too. This show got me through tough times, and I just have to say... Obama ripped off this show! I love Cory in the House. It's very funny. I love the episode when Raven came to visit the White House. I really liked it very much. Loved this show! This was probably around the time when my crush on Jason Dolley developed too. Probably one of the only shows on Disney that actually makes you laugh.\n\nDuckTales DuckTales is an American animated television series produced by Walt Disney Television Animation. It premiered on September 18, 1987 and ended on November 28, 1990 with a total of four seasons and 100 episodes. 24 Excuse me? Why isn't DuckTales above Wizards of Waverly Place? Get DuckTales up to number 1. Disney Channel doesn't deserve to make more sitcoms than cartoons. I loved this show when I was a kid. I used to watch this when I was little.

He gives me the card, the whole movie starts. The kid actually starts, \u2018You just killed Santa.\u2019 And I said, \u2018He shouldn\u2019t have been on the roof when he wasn\u2019t invited.' \u201d\n\nIn the 1994 holiday classic, Scott Calvin (Allen) startles Santa, causing the big guy to fall from the roof. When Santa gives Scott a card telling him he's next in line to fill out the red suit and shiny black boots, the Ho Ho Holidays really get rolling.\n\nBut wait, we didn't see Scott brandishing a firearm, did we?\n\n\u201cI\u2019m laughing so hard, but the head of Disney at the time, (Jeffrey) Katzenberg said, \u2018Well, we can\u2019t start a movie like that,\u2019 and I said, \u2018Why not?\u2019 \" Allen recalled. \"And he said, \u2018We can\u2019t start a Disney movie with you murdering Santa.' \u201d\n\nSo it was the fall, not something more dire, that does in the man in red.", "images": ["https://www.ktvb.com/assets/shared-images/icons/close-menu.svg", "https://media.ktvb.com/assets/KTVB/images/b9387c3b-9ac1-4d00-8cca-ad1eac5d007c/b9387c3b-9ac1-4d00-8cca-ad1eac5d007c_360x203.jpg", "https://www.ktvb.com/assets/shared-images/weather-icons/clear-day_210x210.png", "https://media.ktvb.com/assets/WQAD/images/b1a4e323-7400-4309-9ed3-79366e3922c9/b1a4e323-7400-4309-9ed3-79366e3922c9_360x203.jpg", "https://media.ktvb.com/assets/CCT/images/a1f09a63-2b3e-4966-ba0a-271108aba4bd/a1f09a63-2b3e-4966-ba0a-271108aba4bd_16x9.jpg", "https://media.ktvb.com/assets/KTVB/images/5922b6db-c51d-4d4f-9368-e07dba60266a/5922b6db-c51d-4d4f-9368-e07dba60266a_360x203.jpg", "https://www.ktvb.com/assets/shared-images/logos/ktvb.png", "https://www.ktvb.com/assets/shared-images/logos/native/ktvb.svg", "https://media.ktvb.com/assets/CCT/images/617046344/617046344_750x422.jpg", "https://www.ktvb.com/assets/shared-images/icons/facebook.svg", "https://media.ktvb.com/assets/KTVB/images/26162fb5-688b-492e-bcbf-9ca93960d6ae/26162fb5-688b-492e-bcbf-9ca93960d6ae_1920x1080.jpg", "https://media.ktvb.com/assets/WQAD/images/b1a4e323-7400-4309-9ed3-79366e3922c9/b1a4e323-7400-4309-9ed3-79366e3922c9_16x9.jpg", "https://media.ktvb.com/assets/KTVB/images/5922b6db-c51d-4d4f-9368-e07dba60266a/5922b6db-c51d-4d4f-9368-e07dba60266a_16x9.jpg", "https://media.ktvb.com/assets/CCT/images/617046344/617046344_1140x641.jpg", "https://media.ktvb.com/assets/CCT/images/617046344/617046344_16x9.jpg", "https://www.ktvb.com/assets/shared-images/icons/twitter.svg", "https://media.ktvb.com/assets/CCT/images/a1f09a63-2b3e-4966-ba0a-271108aba4bd/a1f09a63-2b3e-4966-ba0a-271108aba4bd_360x203.jpg", "https://media.ktvb.com/assets/KTVB/images/b9387c3b-9ac1-4d00-8cca-ad1eac5d007c/b9387c3b-9ac1-4d00-8cca-ad1eac5d007c_16x9.jpg"], "top_img": "https://media.ktvb.com/assets/CCT/images/617046344/617046344_1140x641.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": [], "canonical_link": "https://www.ktvb.com/article/news/nation-world/tim-allen-reveals-the-santa-clause-originally-had-a-very-morbid-twist/507-617046196", "title": "Tim Allen reveals 'The Santa Clause' originally had a very morbid twist", "meta_data": {"theme-color": "#d81f32", "category": "news", "og": {"url": "https://www.ktvb.com/article/news/nation-world/tim-allen-reveals-the-santa-clause-originally-had-a-very-morbid-twist/507-617046196", "title": "Tim Allen reveals 'The Santa Clause' originally had a very morbid twist", "description": "Tim Allen told Jimmy Fallon, \"The original 'Santa Clause' is a little darker \u2026 and I actually shot and killed Santa.\"", "type": "article", "image": {"identifier": "https://media.ktvb.com/assets/CCT/images/617046344/617046344_1140x641.jpg", "width": 1140, "height": 641}, "article": {"published_time": "11/23/2018 5:36:25 AM"}, "site_name": "ktvb.com", "locale": "en_US"}, "article": {"opinion": "false", "content_tier": "free", "section": "ktvb,news,nation-world,facebook-instant,entertainment-news"}, "twitter": {"title": "Tim Allen reveals 'The Santa Clause' originally had a very morbid twist", "image": "https://media.ktvb.com/assets/CCT/images/617046344/617046344_1140x641.jpg", "card": "summary_large_image", "site": "KTVB", "description": "Tim Allen told Jimmy Fallon, \"The original 'Santa Clause' is a little darker \u2026 and I actually shot and killed Santa.\"", "domain": "www.ktvb.com/"}, "viewport": "width=1170", "site": "ktvb.com", "description": "Tim Allen told Jimmy Fallon, \"The original 'Santa Clause' is a little darker \u2026 and I actually shot and killed Santa.\"", "fb": {"app_id": 192179838029342}, "robots": "max-image-preview:large"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1542922585.0, "source": "https://www.ktvb.com", "summary": ""}

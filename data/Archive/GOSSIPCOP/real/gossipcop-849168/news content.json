I am absolutely blown away by the passion and commitment of the Oncer fans. I am so honored to have been a central part of such a special show. I will be forever grateful to Adam, Eddy, and ABC for giving me the gift of playing Emma Swan.\"\n\nKitsis and Horowitz issued a statement praising Morrison's contribution to the show.\n\n\"As six amazing seasons reach their crescendo, we're thrilled to close an exciting chapter in the life of Emma Swan. These years collaborating with Jennifer have been truly magical. Watching her breathe life into Emma, we saw her accomplish more than we could have dreamed possible \u2014 she gave life to a brand new Disney Princess, filled with strength and intelligence and an incredible closet full of red leather jackets,\" they said.\n\n\"We'll miss seeing her every day, but her imprint on Once Upon a Time is indelible. She will always be a part of the show and its heart and soul. That said, just because Jennifer won't be back as a regular, that doesn't mean we won't see our savior at all next season.\"", "images": ["https://www.usatoday.com/gcdn/-mm-/b5e5d0dc23ce81981622875f2dd6cb99d6a1bd06/c=0-54-2335-3168/local/-/media/2017/05/08/USATODAY/USATODAY/636298587056905931-Jennifer-Morrison.jpg?width=300&height=401&fit=crop&format=pjpg&auto=webp", "https://www.usatoday.com/gcdn/-mm-/c31196df9d64b0d8f9aa466277cf29404c3d0dde/c=0-498-2335-1817/local/-/media/2017/05/08/USATODAY/USATODAY/636298587056905931-Jennifer-Morrison.jpg?width=2335&height=1319&fit=crop&format=pjpg&auto=webp"], "top_img": "https://www.usatoday.com/gcdn/-mm-/c31196df9d64b0d8f9aa466277cf29404c3d0dde/c=0-498-2335-1817/local/-/media/2017/05/08/USATODAY/USATODAY/636298587056905931-Jennifer-Morrison.jpg?width=2335&height=1319&fit=crop&format=pjpg&auto=webp", "keywords": [], "authors": [], "canonical_link": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/life/tv/2017/05/08/jennifer-morrison-leaving-abc-once-upon-time/101443526/", "title": "Jennifer Morrison is leaving ABC's 'Once Upon a Time'", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1,minimum-scale=1", "theme-color": "#0098FE", "og": {"title": "Jennifer Morrison is leaving ABC's 'Once Upon a Time'", "description": "Actress who plays Emma Swan won't be back for a seventh season.", "url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/life/tv/2017/05/08/jennifer-morrison-leaving-abc-once-upon-time/101443526/", "site_name": "USA TODAY", "image": {"identifier": "https://www.usatoday.com/gcdn/-mm-/c31196df9d64b0d8f9aa466277cf29404c3d0dde/c=0-498-2335-1817/local/-/media/2017/05/08/USATODAY/USATODAY/636298587056905931-Jennifer-Morrison.jpg?width=2335&height=1319&fit=crop&format=pjpg&auto=webp", "width": 2335, "height": 1319}, "type": "article"}, "article": {"author": "Bill Keveney", "content_tier": "free", "opinion": "false"}, "description": "Actress who plays Emma Swan won't be back for a seventh season.", "fb": {"pages": "13652355666,48958576760,156345381090801,110471702456365,6566864515,137698179626815,315942225236045,927427260614748,183850168300771,1443524575938047,251228454889939,158095147555989,115535341805950,236655713446291,1621466394844549,250325640686,177037772444433,1972936962947967,2047091012096533,535551216797440", "app_id": 215046668549694}, "ROBOTS": "NOODP, NOYDIR, max-image-preview:large", "google": "notranslate", "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "image": "https://www.usatoday.com/gcdn/-mm-/c31196df9d64b0d8f9aa466277cf29404c3d0dde/c=0-498-2335-1817/local/-/media/2017/05/08/USATODAY/USATODAY/636298587056905931-Jennifer-Morrison.jpg?width=1600&height=800&fit=crop&format=pjpg&auto=webp", "site": "@usatoday", "creator": "@usatoday", "title": "Jennifer Morrison is leaving ABC's 'Once Upon a Time'", "description": "Actress who plays Emma Swan won't be back for a seventh season."}}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1494172800.0, "source": "https://www.usatoday.com", "summary": ""}

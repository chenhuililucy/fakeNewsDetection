Ready for it? HERE YA GO:\n\nThis content is imported from twitter. You may be able to find the same content in another format, or you may be able to find more information, at their web site. Good luck on your blog. \u2014 Demi Lovato (@ddlovato) July 6, 2018\n\nUmmm, what now?!\n\n\n\nAs you can plainly see, Demi is shadily wishing someone \"good luck\" with their \"blog,\" and the internet is determined to find out who she's talking about. Including Ruby Rose, who helpfully tweeted this in response:\n\nMore From Cosmopolitan\n\nWhile there are plenty of fan theories about who this could be, most people seem to think the subject of Demi's tweet is Mike Bayer, a life coach who's gone on tour with Demi, and posted a video that fans think was about her.\n\n\"I worked in entertainment for many years being a life coach for a lot of different pop stars and actors, and my biggest pet peeve is when they use excuses because they call themselves 'artists',\" Bayer says in the video. \"I\u2019m here today to explain to you that being an artist and being talented are two different things. To me being an artist is living your authentic life. I believe everyone out there is an artist.\"\n\nHe continued, \"I think if somebody uses it as an excuse to be late, or insincere, or rude, or unapologetic, that\u2019s not being an artist, that\u2019s being a jerk. And you shouldn\u2019t stand for that.\"\n\nNaturally, Demi's fans are already tweeting at Mike, and \"good luck\" is quickly becoming a meme:\n\n\n\nThis content is imported from twitter.

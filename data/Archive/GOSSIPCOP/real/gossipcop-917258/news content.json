A lot of people sent (the video) to me. I was really touched.\"Before they got to meet, Colbert asked Glover for his thoughts on the video.\n\nRelated: Georgia dad, daughter sing their way to more Girl Scout cookie sales\n\nCharity Joy had to sell 113 more boxes of cookies to meet her goal, and Glover bought them all.\n\nColbert then brought out a basket full of Thin Mints -- Charity Joy\u2019s favorite -- and helped the Girl Scout, her father and Glover hand out boxes to the audience.\n\nWatch Charity Joy\u2019s appearance on \u201cThe Late Show with Stephen Colbert\u201d at the 7:25 mark at the video below.", "images": ["https://www.ajc.com/entertainment/donald-glover-meets-girl-scout-who-sang-redbone-buys-113-boxes-cookies/ISG8ZQiZKtwtQPtiz8lNGL/[object Object]", "https://www.ajc.com/pf/resources/images/ajc-hamburger-menu.png?d=1003", "https://www.ajc.com/resizer/vBT5HecXevwbGJcMPpOTqwBiNj0=/1200x630/d1fegwn2wjh0cs.cloudfront.net/06-28-2020/t_4a8c9393d4b74f95af89f99b83b789c7_name_13D171A2997E4C99A96EA540BD71D47B", "https://www.ajc.com/pf/resources/images/amp-close.png?d=1003", "https://www.ajc.com/pf/resources/logos/AJC/sidebar-logo.png?d=1003"], "top_img": "https://www.ajc.com/resizer/vBT5HecXevwbGJcMPpOTqwBiNj0=/1200x630/d1fegwn2wjh0cs.cloudfront.net/06-28-2020/t_4a8c9393d4b74f95af89f99b83b789c7_name_13D171A2997E4C99A96EA540BD71D47B", "keywords": [], "authors": ["About The Author", "Kelcie Willis", "Cox Media Group National Content Desk"], "canonical_link": "https://www.ajc.com/entertainment/donald-glover-meets-girl-scout-who-sang-redbone-buys-113-boxes-cookies/ISG8ZQiZKtwtQPtiz8lNGL/", "title": "Donald Glover meets Girl Scout who sang \u2018Redbone,\u2019 buys 113 boxes of cookies", "meta_data": {"description": "Childish Gambino, aka Donald Glover, met a special Girl Scout who used his song,\u00a0\"Redbone,\" to sell cookies\u00a0in a viral video on\u00a0\"The Late Show with St", "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "description": "Childish Gambino, aka Donald Glover, met a special Girl Scout who used his song,\u00a0\"Redbone,\" to sell cookies\u00a0in a viral video on\u00a0\"The Late Show with Stephen Colbert\" Wednesday night.", "image": "https://www.ajc.com/resizer/vBT5HecXevwbGJcMPpOTqwBiNj0=/1200x630/d1fegwn2wjh0cs.cloudfront.net/06-28-2020/t_4a8c9393d4b74f95af89f99b83b789c7_name_13D171A2997E4C99A96EA540BD71D47B", "site": "@ajc", "title": "Donald Glover meets Girl Scout who sang \u2018Redbone,\u2019 buys 113 boxes of cookies", "url": "https://www.ajc.com/entertainment/donald-glover-meets-girl-scout-who-sang-redbone-buys-113-boxes-cookies/ISG8ZQiZKtwtQPtiz8lNGL/"}, "fb": {"app_id": 366816260017522, "pages": 13310147298}, "og": {"image": {"identifier": "https://www.ajc.com/resizer/vBT5HecXevwbGJcMPpOTqwBiNj0=/1200x630/d1fegwn2wjh0cs.cloudfront.net/06-28-2020/t_4a8c9393d4b74f95af89f99b83b789c7_name_13D171A2997E4C99A96EA540BD71D47B", "secure_url": "https://www.ajc.com/resizer/vBT5HecXevwbGJcMPpOTqwBiNj0=/1200x630/d1fegwn2wjh0cs.cloudfront.net/06-28-2020/t_4a8c9393d4b74f95af89f99b83b789c7_name_13D171A2997E4C99A96EA540BD71D47B", "type": "image/jpeg", "height": 630, "width": 1200}, "title": "Donald Glover meets Girl Scout who sang \u2018Redbone,\u2019 buys 113 boxes of cookies", "type": "article", "url": "https://www.ajc.com/entertainment/donald-glover-meets-girl-scout-who-sang-redbone-buys-113-boxes-cookies/ISG8ZQiZKtwtQPtiz8lNGL/", "description": "Childish Gambino, aka Donald Glover, met a special Girl Scout who used his song,\u00a0\"Redbone,\" to sell cookies\u00a0in a viral video on\u00a0\"The Late Show with Stephen Colbert\" Wednesday night.", "site_name": "ajc"}, "thumbnail": "https://www.ajc.com/resizer/vBT5HecXevwbGJcMPpOTqwBiNj0=/1200x630/d1fegwn2wjh0cs.cloudfront.net/06-28-2020/t_4a8c9393d4b74f95af89f99b83b789c7_name_13D171A2997E4C99A96EA540BD71D47B", "language": "English", "article": {"opinion": "false"}, "story.meter": "free", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "movies": ["https://www.youtube.com/embed/itE8Cd85-QM?start=445"], "publish_date": null, "source": "https://www.ajc.com", "summary": ""}

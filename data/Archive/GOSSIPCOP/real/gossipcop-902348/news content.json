I\u2019m grateful.\"\n\nThe 80-year-old's early years were marked by tragedy. Her mother suffered from mental illness and committed suicide when Fonda was only 12 years old.\n\n\"I assumed...I would die lonely and an addict of some sort.\" \u2014 Jane Fonda\n\nFonda, whose father was actor Henry Fonda, said she lived a \"fraught adolescence\" and suffered from bulimia for decades.\n\nDespite her difficult upbringing, the actress said she has a lot to be thankful for today.\n\n\"I'm thankful that I've gotten better over the 80 years,\" she said.\n\n\"I\u2019m less judgmental. I\u2019m forgiving. It wasn\u2019t always true. I\u2019ve really worked hard to get better as a human being.\"\n\nMost recently, she's earned praise for her role in Netflix's \"Grace and Frankie,\" which garnered Emmy nominations in 2016 and 2017.

Here are six things to know about SZA. (And here's a bonus seventh: How to pronounce SZA: siz-uh!)\n\nFollow live with us:Live-Tweeting the Grammy's (with local shoutouts)\n\n1. SZA is from Maplewood\n\nShe was born Sol\u00e1na Imani Rowe on Nov. 8, 1989, and grew up in Maplewood, New Jersey, attending Columbia High School (the same high school of singer-songwriter Lauryn Hill).\n\n2. How many Grammys is SZA nominated for?\n\nShe is the most nominated female at this year's Grammy Awards, with five nominations: Best New Artist, Best R&B Song (\"Supermodel\"), Best Rap/Sung Collabration (\"Love Galore\"), Best R&B Performance (The Weekend), and Best Urban Contemporary Album (Ctrl).\n\n3. SZA as supermodel\n\nShe is the face of the newest GAP campaign Archive Reissue \u2014 Logo Remix, a collection of apparel for men and women highlighting the GAP logo.\n\n4. SZA has collaborated with Beyonce and Nicki Minaj\n\nSZA co-wrote the Beyonce and Nicki Minaj hit song \"Feeling Myself.\"\n\n5. SZA was a gymnast\n\nShe was a gymnast for 13 years but when she realized the Olympics were not in her future, she decided to focus on other things.\n\n6. SZA has to watch what she eats\n\nShe suffers from gluten allergies and is lactose intolerant. She told Nylon Magazine in a recent interview, \"I love food, so having a lot of food allergies now and just having a really sensitive body, it forces me to be very mindful and conscious and eat when I\u2019m hungry, not just when I\u2019m bored and just really slow down. Everything in moderation.\"\n\nMore entertainment news\n\nCongratulations:Singer Christina Perri and Paul Costabile welcome baby girl\n\nDay trip:At the Grammy Museum at the Prudential Center in Newark, it's always award season\n\nDeals:Get Discounted Tickets To Music Festivals", "images": ["https://www.northjersey.com/gcdn/-mm-/ff5238309c282df4dcef901f7d025f52751931e0/c=0-60-600-660/local/-/media/2017/10/11/Bergen/NorthJersey/636433333661917744-HeadShot-AdamsStiansenLaura-002.jpg?width=48&height=48&fit=crop&format=pjpg&auto=webp", "https://www.northjersey.com/gcdn/-mm-/332724df79ead1434e2864c356f21eab95d49596/c=92-186-1156-787/local/-/media/2018/01/27/Bergen/NorthJersey/636526442422936083-SUB-SZA-Gap-2.jpg?width=1064&height=601&fit=crop&format=pjpg&auto=webp"], "top_img": "https://www.northjersey.com/gcdn/-mm-/332724df79ead1434e2864c356f21eab95d49596/c=92-186-1156-787/local/-/media/2018/01/27/Bergen/NorthJersey/636526442422936083-SUB-SZA-Gap-2.jpg?width=1064&height=601&fit=crop&format=pjpg&auto=webp", "keywords": [], "authors": [], "canonical_link": "https://www.northjersey.com/story/entertainment/music/2018/01/28/6-things-know-sza-grammy-nominated-r-b-singer-songwriter-maplewood/1071820001/", "title": "SZA: 6 things to know about the Grammy nominated singer from Maplewood", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1,minimum-scale=1", "theme-color": "#0098FE", "og": {"title": "SZA: 6 things to know about the Grammy nominated singer from Maplewood", "description": "With the Grammy Awards airing 7:30 p.m. tonight on CBS, it's a good time to get to know nominee SZA, a Maplewood native", "url": "https://www.northjersey.com/story/entertainment/music/2018/01/28/6-things-know-sza-grammy-nominated-r-b-singer-songwriter-maplewood/1071820001/", "site_name": "North Jersey Media Group", "image": {"identifier": "https://www.northjersey.com/gcdn/-mm-/332724df79ead1434e2864c356f21eab95d49596/c=92-186-1156-787/local/-/media/2018/01/27/Bergen/NorthJersey/636526442422936083-SUB-SZA-Gap-2.jpg?width=1064&height=601&fit=crop&format=pjpg&auto=webp", "width": 1064, "height": 601}, "type": "article"}, "article": {"author": "Laura Adams Stiansen", "content_tier": "free", "opinion": "false"}, "description": "With the Grammy Awards airing 7:30 p.m. tonight on CBS, it's a good time to get to know nominee SZA, a Maplewood native", "fb": {"pages": 117907407522, "app_id": 130358300392751}, "ROBOTS": "NOODP, NOYDIR, max-image-preview:large", "google": "notranslate", "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "image": "https://www.northjersey.com/gcdn/-mm-/332724df79ead1434e2864c356f21eab95d49596/c=92-186-1156-787/local/-/media/2018/01/27/Bergen/NorthJersey/636526442422936083-SUB-SZA-Gap-2.jpg?width=1064&height=532&fit=crop&format=pjpg&auto=webp", "site": "@northjersey", "creator": "@northjersey", "title": "SZA: 6 things to know about the Grammy nominated singer from Maplewood", "description": "With the Grammy Awards airing 7:30 p.m. tonight on CBS, it's a good time to get to know nominee SZA, a Maplewood native"}}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1517068800.0, "source": "https://www.northjersey.com", "summary": ""}

My grandfather was my pastor growing up. My dad is a pastor himself and played drums in the church choir, my mother was a choir director, and my grandmother was the church organist. My dad would even play Jesus in some of our passion plays in church. I\u2019m not religious now, I would say, but there\u2019s no way that you are raised in that environment, and also grow up singing that music, without it having an impact on your life.\n\nOn musicals My first contact with Andrew Lloyd Webber was in a show choir, \u201cGlee\u201d-style, where we would sing show tunes. And I was in a few actual theater productions \u2014 \u201cBig River,\u201d \u201cFiddler on the Roof,\u201d and \u201cYou\u2019re a Good Man, Charlie Brown\u201d \u2014 when I was in high school. The hardest part now was just learning all the material \u2014 I\u2019m so used to performing songs that I wrote for myself.\n\nOn Jesus Preparing for this particular role is not just about understanding historical Jesus. A lot of it goes back to thinking about love, and what that means \u2014 love for the people who are close to you, but also for mankind, and what that means when it comes to thinking about the sacrifice that he was willing to make.\n\nOn \u2018Superstar\u2019 The show is an interesting conceit \u2014 the idea of thinking about the real human emotions that someone that a lot of people see as a deity may have felt; the idea that he might have felt doubt and fear and resentment toward his father; the idea that he was betrayed by his friends. And, in this show, Andrew and Tim suggest that Judas may have had a point \u2014 Judas may have had really good reasons for questioning Jesus\u2019s m.o.\n\nBrandon Victor Dixon (Judas)\n\nPhoto\n\nOn religion I grew up in the Episcopal Church, went to private school in that church, went to chapel every day. It was a constant through my adolescence. Then we started to shift, to the Unitarian church. Now, spirituality plays a role in my life, but not religion. For me religion is a political construct, and spirituality is a community construct, and there\u2019s a real difference.\n\nOn musicals I work in musical theater because people keep writing quality stories in the genre, and I\u2019m really all about investing in a piece that says something about our current time, that is a reflection on who we are today.\n\nOn Judas What I\u2019ve learned is that Judas is far less culpable of the things that he is accused of than people assume. Judas feels acutely a perversion of the message, and he also feels the danger of the message getting out of control \u2014 of dedication and love and unity and community turning into fanaticism and zealotry.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nOn \u2018Superstar\u2019 I had never seen the show, had never heard the soundtrack \u2014 I really had no clue until I got this job. I watched the movie up until Judas was dead \u2014 that probably says something about my own personal character \u2014 and then we were in rehearsal and I overheard the musical director saying something about \u2018You know, after Judas comes back\u2019 \u2014 and I was like, \u2018What? Judas comes back?\u2019 And I went home and I finished the movie and found out Judas comes back and sings the best song in the entire show. I was floored.\n\nSara Bareilles (Mary Magdalene)\n\nPhoto\n\nOn religion I\u2019m definitely someone who has faith and a belief in God and the workings of the universe at large, but I don\u2019t subscribe to a particular doctrine. I grew up Catholic, and I went to Catholic school, so the story of Jesus and the crucifixion are very near and dear to my heart. I still go to Catholic Mass with my parents when I go home. The ritual and the familiarity and the comfort of our church community growing up is something I look back on really fondly now, even though I don\u2019t go to church any more.\n\nOn musicals It\u2019s this medium that exists somewhere between feet-on-the-ground and lifting off. It\u2019s sort of elevated reality, where you get to tell really beautiful stories, but everything is slightly surreal, and I really love what unlocks emotionally for people.\n\nOn Mary Magdalene She\u2019s actually a very powerful figure, and she is really motivated by her love for Jesus and his message. Historically, she was definitely a disciple and a believer and a champion of his message. She\u2019s got laser focus on her support of Jesus, in my interpretation, and that\u2019s how I\u2019m coming to it, with a pure sense of the ultimate kind of love for someone.\n\nOn \u2018Superstar\u2019 I rented the film \u2014 I was probably 12 or 13 and I was really into a lot of Andrew Lloyd Webber\u2019s musicals at the time, and I was listening to everything I could get my hands on. I remember just being really emotional about the music. What was so avant-garde and so revolutionary about Tim and Andrew\u2019s approach was that they really emphasized the humanity of these figures that have become so mythologized for us over the years. For someone who grew up in the church, as intimate as your relationship to Jesus can be, it\u2019s really interesting and nuanced to look at him as a human and to look at Mary as a human and Judas as a human.\n\nAlice Cooper (King Herod)\n\nPhoto\n\nOn religion My dad was a pastor. My grandfather was an evangelist. And my wife\u2019s father is a Baptist pastor. I was basically the prodigal child \u2014 I grew up in the church, went as far away as you could possibly go, and then came back. When I got sober, I started understanding \u2014 I had all the fame and the money and everything that went with it, but I started realizing what was important to me was my relationship with Jesus Christ, who I just absolutely torture in this show.\n\nI study the Bible every morning. When I\u2019m at home I have a Wednesday morning men\u2019s Bible study. I pray before every show. I go to church every Sunday with my wife and kids. I don\u2019t think I\u2019ve ever been more happy in my life. People say, \u2018Think of all you gave up to be a Christian.\u2019 What did I give up? Dying of alcoholism? I\u2019m not giving anything up. I\u2019m giving it back, to him.\n\nOn musicals I am just fascinated by the musical. One of my Sirius stations is always Broadway. \u2018A Chorus Line\u2019 was one of the greatest ones. And \u2018Guys and Dolls\u2019 \u2014 my dad was a big fan of Damon Runyon.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nWhen I was 16, we had a band called The Spiders, in Phoenix, and we got a call for a production of \u2018Bye Bye Birdie\u2019 \u2014 \u2018Would you guys be the Birdies?\u2019 So we got to be in this run, in real theater. That may have been where the whole Alice Cooper theatrics came from.\n\nOn Herod I think he\u2019s going to be sort of an Elvis impersonator \u2014 I\u2019m all in gold, and I\u2019ve got a gold suit on that fits really good. The director wants this guy to be half rock star, half king. That\u2019s how I want to play this. This Herod is a swirling mass of paranoia and ego. He starts out being very egocentric, but he\u2019s getting angrier and angrier as it goes along, and pretty soon at the very end he\u2019s right in Jesus\u2019s face \u2014 he\u2019s so tired of this guy.\n\nOn \u2018Superstar\u2019 There has never been a character in history that has ever had more written about him than Jesus Christ. There\u2019s an underlying thing that everybody still wants to know who this guy was.", "images":

And while there was some speculation that the soiree was actually a secret wedding\u2014Jennifer Aniston, Reese Witherspoon, and more A-listers showed\u2014multiple sources confirmed to Page Six it really was just an extravagant engagement celebration. A wedding is said to be scheduled in the Hamptons later this year.\n\nGP is wearing a new ring though after the party. She showed off a \"BF\" gold band on her left ring finger at the Pre-Broadway Opening Engagement Of Head Over Heels in San Francisco. BF is obviously Falchuk's initials, so she's very clearly wearing a tribute to her husband-to-be. Whether the ring will be a regular addition to Paltrow's outfits or is just a one-night statement piece, future red carpet appearances will determine. But it's a pretty smart move on Paltrow's part to keep outlets buzzing about her future secret wedding whenever that may actually be:\n\nGetty Images\n\nGetty Images\n\nThis content is imported from poll.

She wrote: \"Thank you @mrrpmurphy for the most incredible evening to celebrate our \u2764\ufe0f. There will never be adequate words to express our gratitude. @giambattistavalliparis I will never get over my gorgeous dress. @georgieeisdell thank you. @hairbylorenzomartin thank you. @teamsaltzman thank you.

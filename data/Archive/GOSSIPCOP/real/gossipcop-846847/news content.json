Photo: The Ellen Show\n\nOn April 30, 1997, Ellen DeGeneres came out on her eponymous sitcom, Ellen. To celebrate the 20th anniversary of that historic television moment, DeGeneres sat down with Oprah Winfrey, Laura Dern, and cast members from the show to discuss her choice to come out publicly, the backlash she experienced after, and the impact that her decision had on the pop-culture conversation around LGBT issues. DeGeneres even explains that the coming-out episode was titled \u201cThe Puppy Episode\u201d because \u201c\u2019Ellen Throws Her Career Away\u2019 seemed a little too on the nose.\u201d Actually, that\u2019s not the real reason for the \u201cPuppy Episode\u201d name, but you can see Ellen\u2019s explanation for it below. In an interview with Oprah after the coming out aired, the comedian said she did so \u201cbecause it\u2019s okay. Because it is okay,\u201d and, thanks in part to Ellen, that became a little more true in Hollywood.", "images": ["https://assets.nymag.com/media/components/customer-alert-banner/alert.svg", "https://pyxis.nymag.com/v1/imgs/996/ebf/708e2682c67ea6423534eb449f0c607761-sam-bankman-fried.2x.rsquare-zoom.w75.jpg", "https://pyxis.nymag.com/v1/imgs/fd1/2c2/0cceaf7f8ea65d263a2a1419e4776b9965-2123Cov-4x5-GOP-Primary.w240.jpg", "https://pyxis.nymag.com/v1/imgs/eb9/2f6/90655c8710123c1ef6412b7142a4e5cb46-jordan-crucchiola-2019.2x.rsquare.w168.jpg", "https://pyxis.nymag.com/v1/imgs/6d0/32d/429e20c3a12c3c71eb5ec3b0dbc61b9cad-28-ellen-oprah-laura-dern.rsquare.w330.jpg", "https://pyxis.nymag.com/v1/imgs/8df/879/45409a2249f67ed3cddf3f0df1579b35f9-teens-antiaging-skincare.2x.rsquare-zoom.w75.jpg", "https://pyxis.nymag.com/v1/imgs/6d0/32d/429e20c3a12c3c71eb5ec3b0dbc61b9cad-28-ellen-oprah-laura-dern.1x.rsocial.w1200.jpg", "https://assets.nymag.com/media/components/customer-alert-banner/double_chevron.svg", "https://pyxis.nymag.com/v1/imgs/305/4b0/de42bd377c2dfcff8887b3311621dd8921-Esther.2x.rsquare-zoom.w75.jpg ", "https://assets.nymag.com/media/components/customer-alert-banner/close_x.svg"], "top_img": "https://pyxis.nymag.com/v1/imgs/6d0/32d/429e20c3a12c3c71eb5ec3b0dbc61b9cad-28-ellen-oprah-laura-dern.1x.rsocial.w1200.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Jordan Crucchiola"], "canonical_link": "https://www.vulture.com/2017/04/ellen-degeneres-looks-back-on-her-coming-out-episode.html", "title": "Ellen DeGeneres Looks Back on Her Coming-Out Episode", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1,shrink-to-fit=no", "parsely-tags": "ellen degeneres, tv, milestones, featuretype:news-aggregation", "og": {"title": "Ellen DeGeneres Looks Back on Her Coming-Out Episode on its 20th Anniversary", "url": "https://www.vulture.com/2017/04/ellen-degeneres-looks-back-on-her-coming-out-episode.html", "description": "Ever wonder why it was called \u201cThe Puppy Episode\u201d?", "image": "https://pyxis.nymag.com/v1/imgs/6d0/32d/429e20c3a12c3c71eb5ec3b0dbc61b9cad-28-ellen-oprah-laura-dern.1x.rsocial.w1200.jpg", "site_name": "Vulture", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"title": "Ellen DeGeneres Looks Back on Her Coming-Out Episode", "description": "Ever wonder why it was called \u201cThe Puppy Episode\u201d?", "image": "https://pyxis.nymag.com/v1/imgs/6d0/32d/429e20c3a12c3c71eb5ec3b0dbc61b9cad-28-ellen-oprah-laura-dern.2x.rsocial.w600.jpg", "card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@jorcru", "site": "@vulture"}, "description": "Ever wonder why it was called \u201cThe Puppy Episode\u201d?", "robots": "max-image-preview:large", "article": {"tag": "ellen degeneres, tv, milestones", "publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/Vulture"}, "sailthru.tags": "ellen degeneres, tv, milestones", "author": "Jordan Crucchiola", "fb": {"app_id": 158902697551841}, "type": "Article", "vertical": "Vulture", "sectionOverride": "Vulture", "apple-mobile-web-app-title": "Vulture", "application-name": "Vulture", "msapplication-TileColor": "#00bcf1", "msapplication-TileImage": "https://assets.vulture.com/media/sites/vulture/icon.144x144.png"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": null, "source": "https://www.vulture.com", "summary": ""}

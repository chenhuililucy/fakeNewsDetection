Urban\u2019s video for \u201cBlue Ain\u2019t Your Color\u201d won Video of the Year and Male Video of the Year, and Urban won Social Superstar at the fan-voted awards show. His duet with Carrie Underwood on \u201cThe Fighter\u201d won Collaborative Video of the Year, and they turned in one of the night\u2019s most memorable performances \u2014 a stripped bare and emotional performance of their hit.\n\nBy the time his name was announced for Video of the Year, he was nearly speechless.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know what to say. This award is for everybody watching this, everybody outside who couldn\u2019t get in, everybody who comes to see us play in concert. I wish God\u2019s blessings for you and all of your families,\u201d he said. \u201cI love making music.\u201d\n\nCarrie Underwood skated to 17th CMT award\n\nCarrie Underwood has long been a favorite of CMT Music Awards voters, and Wednesday was no different. Add in the fact that Underwood\u2019s husband plays for the Nashville Predators, which are competing for the Stanley Cup, and her camera time only went up.\n\nUnderwood is the awards show\u2019s top-winning singer in its history, and she only grew her margin with two wins Wednesday night. In addition to Underwood\u2019s win with Urban, her \u201cChurch Bells\u201d won Female Video of the Year, bringing her total of CMT Music Awards to 17 over the show\u2019s history.\n\n\u201cThank you to all the people who came out to see us on tour and were a part of this video. This awards show is really cool because it\u2019s fan voted. ...

This post won\u2019t contain many spoilers for their interaction; instead, it dives into a fairly compelling theory that book readers have been working on for decades. But just in case you\u2019d prefer not to read all about it until after you\u2019ve watched Season 7, Episode 3, \u201cThe Queen\u2019s Justice,\u201d now is your time to duck out.\n\nFirst of all, it should shock no one watching Game of Thrones that at some point in the series, the two most telegenic and destiny-laden characters on the series would meet up. Readers have long suspected that George R.R. Martin\u2019s series title, A Song of Ice and Fire, is a reference to the pre-destined adventures of Jon (Ice) and Daenerys (Fire). But that\u2019s not what we\u2019re here to talk about.\n\nWe\u2019re also not here to talk about the deeply held suspicion that these two characters will become romantically involved. Even if the rules of dramatic storytelling didn\u2019t automatically destine two young, compelling, eligible people for a love match, Emilia Clarke and Kit Harington have been fanning the flames in a series of promotional photo shoots, from a 2012 Rolling Stone photoshoot for Season 2 to one, in costume, for Entertainment Weekly in 2013. They were even smooching in an outtake from that Rolling Stone photoshoot held from the magazine (I wonder why!), but released on the photographer\u2019s Instagram in 2016.", "images":

News exclusively.\n\n'Kylie seemed happy to be out and about and was really enjoying the day. She was laughing with Jordyn and having a good time. She was on her phone and texting throughout the meal but was very happy and relaxed. They stayed for a little over an hour before heading out.'\n\nFor the date, Kylie was spotted wearing an oversized black Balenciaga T-shirt, black trousers and a bright red coat.\n\nAnother source told the news outlet that Kylie's mother Kris and her boyfriend Corey Gamble also joined the group for a meal.\n\nKylie and Travis arrived at the lunch in the 20-year-old's ultra luxe black LaFerrari

came a day before Jenner shared an adorable video of her newborn to Snapchat.\n\nSnapchat\n\nIn the clip, the make-up mogul can be seen cradling her daughter's toes and cooing 'Mommy's cute little toes'.\n\nRelated Story Kim Kardashian Just Got Pink Hair\n\nRelated Story Baby Stormi Makes Debut On Kylie Jenner\\'s Snapchat", "images":

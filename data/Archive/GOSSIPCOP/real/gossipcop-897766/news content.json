Then he pointed out that Beyonc\u00e9's email address \"actually changes every week.\"\n\nSheeran said he reached out to her via email and started working on the song in May, but it took a few months to finish the track, which finally dropped on Thursday.\n\n\"Obviously she had twins [in June], and we finished [the song] in September, so I've been holding onto it since then,\" he said of the \"Perfect\" remix.\n\nSpeaking of \"Perfect,\" Sheeran added that Beyonc\u00e9 only needed one take to record the song. Sheeran also said Beyonc\u00e9 had some notes for him.\n\n\"The original version of 'Perfect' was just an acoustic guitar,\" before more instruments were added, he explained. \"[Beyonc\u00e9] rung me up and was like, 'I don't know how you feel about this but I've taken all the instruments off it and it's just gonna be acoustic guitar,' and I was like, 'Ah that's great, because it used to be that!'\"\n\n\"Then when we got in together, it wasn't so much notes, it was very much like a back-and-forth thing, like, 'What'd you think of this?' Or, 'What do you think of this?' And [we were] probably in the studio for four hours.\"\n\nOnce Beyonc\u00e9 began recording, it was smooth sailing.\n\n\"She was just like, 'Right!' Went in, one take, came out, like, 'Yeah, that sounds all right!'\" said Sheeran.

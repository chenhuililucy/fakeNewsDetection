The actor also questioned the necessity for pageantry in sports at all.\n\nDuring a speech in Alabama Friday to campaign for Sen. Luther Strange, Trump said people should boycott the NFL over protests like those demonstrated by former San Francisco 49ers quarterback Colin Kaepernick, who took a knee during the national anthem before games last year to protest police brutality and racial injustices.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cWouldn\u2019t you love to see one of these NFL owners, when somebody disrespects our flag, to say, \u2018Get that son of a bitch off the field right now, he\u2019s fired\u2019?\u201d Trump asked.\n\nAfter a weekend of widespread backlash from NFL players aimed at Trump, Williams sat down with MSNBC and questioned why the anthem is even included in games.\n\nThe actor called Trump \u201ca very horrible, a guy who thinks he\u2019s a dictator, who treats America like it\u2019s a game show.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s also important to realize this anthem thing is a scam,\u201d Williams said. \u201cThis is not actually part of football. This was invented in 2009 from the government paying the NFL to market military recruitment to get more people to go off and fight wars to die.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cThis has nothing to do with [the] NFL, or American pastime, or tradition,\u201d Williams continued. \u201cThis is to get boys and girls to go fly overseas and go kill people. They\u2019re marketing. They\u2019re pumping millions and millions of dollars into the NFL to get us to put on a pageant in front of the NFL football games to get you to go off and fight.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis not only betrays the sentiment and trust of fans, but casts an unfortunate shadow over the genuine patriotic partnerships that do so much for our troops,\u201d the congressional report stated.\n\nAs for the NFL specifically, players were not required to be on the field during the anthem until 2009, per a Vice report.\n\n\u201cAs you know, the NFL has a long tradition of patriotism,\u201d NFL spokesman Brian McCarthy said back in August, confirming that the practice of players being on the field began eight years ago. \u201cPlayers are encouraged but not required to stand for the anthem.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWilliams reiterated his message on Instagram, offering his support to Kaepernick and others taking a knee.", "images": ["https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/59c7b7ff1d00002900e728e6.png?ops=210_120", "https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6723616&c3=&c4=&c5=&c6=&c15=&cj=1", "https://pixel.quantserve.com/pixel/p-3aud4J6uA4Z6Y.gif", "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/59c69c9c1d00002900e727d4.jpeg?cache=eWmoDqI7Au&ops=210_120", "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/59c8c50e19000099555656e6.png?cache=1oPvAYbLTP&ops=210_120", "https://www.facebook.com/tr?id=1621685564716533&ev=PageView&noscript=1", "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/59c8ffbb1a00002650f085a0.png?cache=07HzcTMhk7&ops=1200_630", "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/56bfc27e180000670080beb4.jpg?ops=100_100", "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/573e14671a00002f00c290f0.jpeg?ops=scalefit_960_noupscale"], "top_img": "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/59c8ffbb1a00002650f085a0.png?cache=07HzcTMhk7&ops=1200_630", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Deputy Director Of News", "Analytics"], "canonical_link": "https://www.huffpost.com/entry/jesse-williams-nfl-national-anthem-scam_n_59c8fe84e4b0cdc77332a9ea", "title": "Jesse Williams: NFL National Anthem Is 'A Scam' To Boost Military Recruitment", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, minimum-scale=1.0", "description": "The actor spoke to MSNBC after a weekend of backlash against President Trump's NFL protest remarks.", "keywords": "Donald Trump,NFL,Football,News and Politics,jesse williams", "fb": {"app_id": 46744042133}, "og": {"title": "Jesse Williams: NFL National Anthem Is 'A Scam' To Boost Military Recruitment", "type": "article", "image": {"identifier": "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/59c8ffbb1a00002650f085a0.png?cache=07HzcTMhk7&ops=1200_630", "url": "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/59c8ffbb1a00002650f085a0.png?cache=07HzcTMhk7&ops=1200_630", "type": "image/png", "width": 1200, "height": 630}, "url": "https://www.huffpost.com/entry/jesse-williams-nfl-national-anthem-scam_n_59c8fe84e4b0cdc77332a9ea", "site_name": "HuffPost", "locale": "en_US", "description": "The actor spoke to MSNBC after a weekend of backlash against President Trump's NFL protest remarks."}, "article": {"tag": "Donald Trump,NFL,Football,News and Politics,jesse williams", "section": "Entertainment", "published_time": "2017-09-25T14:14:16Z", "modified_time": "2017-09-25T14:52:50Z"}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "site": "@HuffPostEnt", "title": "Jesse Williams: NFL National Anthem Is 'A Scam' To Boost Military Recruitment", "image": {"identifier": "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/59c8ffbb1a00002650f085a0.png?cache=07HzcTMhk7&ops=1200_630", "width": 1200, "height": 630}, "description": "The actor spoke to MSNBC after a weekend of backlash against President Trump's NFL protest remarks."}, "al": {"ios": {"url": "huffpostnews:///?editionID=us&entryID=us_59c8fe84e4b0cdc77332a9ea", "app_store_id": 306621789, "app_name": "HuffPost"}}, "robots": "max-snippet:-1,max-image-preview:large,max-video-preview:-1", "google-site-verification": "97Mj-wW7u8U1NOnkW1rfH-I1kgO0-a9YsgoesOk41R8"}, "movies": ["https://www.youtube.com/embed/7wwTAo01AKs?rel=0&showinfo=0&enablejsapi=1"], "publish_date": 1506348856.0, "source": "https://www.huffingtonpost.com", "summary": ""}

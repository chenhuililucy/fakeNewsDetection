A few years later he asked me if he had tried anything with me in that first meeting. I realised he couldn't remember if he had assaulted me or not.\"\n\nShe said she said \"no to him professionally many times over the years\" which she said \"undoubtedly harmed my career and was never something I felt supported by anyone other than my family.\"\n\nCara Delevingne\n\nImage copyright Getty Images\n\nIn an Instagram post, Delevingne wrote how uncomfortable she felt during an encounter with Weinstein in a hotel room and describes what allegedly happened when she told him she wanted to leave.\n\n\"He walked me to the door and stood in front of it and tried to kiss me on the lips. I stopped him and managed to get out of the room,\" she said.\n\n\"I still got the part for the film and always thought that he gave it to me because of what happened. Since then I felt awful that I did the movie. I felt like I didn't deserve the part. I was so hesitant about speaking out. I didn't want to hurt his family.\"\n\nLea Seydoux\n\nImage copyright Getty Images\n\nThe French actress Lea Seydoux has written an article detailing her experience with Weinstein who she met at a fashion show.\n\nShe wrote in The Guardian about how he invited her to come to his hotel room for a drink.\n\n\"We were talking on the sofa when he suddenly jumped on me and tried to kiss me.\n\n\"I had to defend myself. He's big and fat, so I had to be forceful to resist him. I left his room, thoroughly disgusted.\n\n\"I wasn't afraid of him, though. Because I knew what kind of man he was all along.\"\n\nGwyneth Paltrow\n\nImage copyright Getty Images Image caption Gwyneth Paltrow with Harvey Weinstein in 2002\n\nIn a statement to the New York Times, Paltrow says after Weinstein cast her in the leading role of Jane Austen adaptation Emma in 1996, she was summoned to his hotel suite.\n\nIt was here that she says, as a 22-year-old, he placed his hands on her and suggested massages.\n\n\"I was a kid, I was signed up, I was petrified,\" she told the newspaper.\n\nShe said she told her then-boyfriend Brad Pitt about the incident, who confronted the producer.\n\n\"I thought he [Weinstein] was going to fire me,\" she said.\n\nAngelina Jolie\n\nImage copyright Getty Images Image caption Angelina Jolie with Gillian Anderson at the premiere of Playing by Heart in 1998\n\nJolie says she was propositioned by Weinstein in a hotel room during the release of Playing by Heart in 1998.\n\nJolie said in an email to the New York Times: \"I had a bad experience with Harvey Weinstein in my youth, and as a result, chose never to work with him again and warn others when they did.\n\n\"This behaviour towards women in any field, any country is unacceptable.\"\n\nAshley Judd\n\nImage copyright Getty Images\n\nAshley Judd told the New York Times she was invited to meet Weinstein at a hotel for what she expected to be a business breakfast meeting.\n\nInstead, she said he had her sent up to his room where he appeared in a bathrobe and asked if he could give her a massage. She added that when she refused, he asked her if she could watch him shower.\n\n\"I said no, a lot of ways, a lot of times, and he always came back at me with some new ask,\" she said. \"It was all this bargaining, this coercive bargaining.\"\n\nRose McGowan\n\nImage copyright Getty Images\n\nThe New York Times reported that in 1997 Weinstein reached \"a previously undisclosed settlement with Rose McGowan\" after an alleged episode in a hotel room during the Sundance Film Festival.\n\nThe $100,000 (\u00a384,000) settlement was \"not to be construed as an admission\" by the movie producer, but intended to \"avoid litigation and buy peace,\" according to the legal document, which was reviewed by The Times.\n\nAt the time McGowan was 23 and had just appeared in Scream.\n\nIn an interview with the Hollywood Reporter she called on the Weinstein board to resign immediately, asking \"for other men to stop other men when they are being disgusting\".\n\n\"Men in Hollywood need to change ASAP,\" she said. \"Hollywood's power is dying because society has changed and grown, and yet Hollywood male behaviour has not.\"\n\nHeather Graham\n\nImage copyright REX/Shutterstock Image caption Harvey Weinstein and Heather Graham at a film party in 1999\n\nThe Boogie Nights actress told Variety she was once propositioned by Weinstein in the early 2000s when she met him to discuss being cast in one of his movies.\n\nShe alleges he tried to force himself on her and told her his wife would have been fine with it.\n\n\"He could sleep with whomever he wanted when he was out of town. I walked out of the meeting feeling uneasy.\n\n\"There was no explicit mention that to star in one of those films I had to sleep with him, but the subtext was there.\"\n\nZoe Brock\n\nMedia playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Model Zoe Brock tells Radio 4's Today that she was one of Harvey Weinstein's victims\n\nModel and actress Zoe Brock says she was brought back to Weinstein's hotel room under false pretences in the south of France in 1997.\n\nHe emerged naked from another part of the suite and asked for a massage, she told BBC Radio 4's Today programme.\n\n\"I did not want to do that and he asked if he could give me a massage... I didn't know what to do and I felt that letting him maybe touch me a little bit might placate him enough to get me out of there somehow.\"\n\nBefore long, she \"bolted\" into the bathroom. He banged on the door with his fists before eventually retreating, putting on a dressing gown and starting to cry.\n\nAsia Argento\n\nImage copyright Getty Images Image caption Asia Argento at the 70th annual Cannes Film Festival\n\nItalian actress and director Asia Argento's first dealing with Weinstein's company Miramax was when she appeared in their crime drama B Monkey.\n\nShe says she was left alone with him in a hotel room on the French Riviera after being told she was going to a Miramax party.\n\nArgento says she reluctantly agreed to give him a massage, but he then raped her.\n\nWeinstein \"terrified me, and he was so big\", she said. \"It wouldn't stop. It was a nightmare.\"\n\n\"I know he has crushed a lot of people before. That's why this story - in my case, it's 20 years old, some of them are old - has never come out.\"\n\nArgento has not spoken out until now, saying she feared it would ruin her career to do so.\n\nLucia Stoller\n\nStoller, now called Lucia Evans, encountered Weinstein in 2004 in a New York club when she was an aspiring actress.\n\nShe claims she was forced into a sexual act by the producer after going to his office for a casting meeting.\n\n\"The type of control he exerted, it was very real,\" she told The New Yorker. \"Even just his presence was intimidating.\"\n\nMira Sorvino\n\nImage copyright Getty Images Image caption Mira Sorvino was photographed at a Weinstein Company party in January 2017\n\nMira Sorvino appeared in several of Weinstein's films and told The New Yorker he sexually harassed her and tried to pressure her into having a physical relationship.\n\nShe was in a hotel room with him at the Toronto International Film Festival in 1995 while promoting Mighty Aphrodite, for which she later won an Oscar.\n\n\"He started massaging my shoulders, which made me very uncomfortable, and then tried to get more physical, sort of chasing me around.\"\n\nWeeks later, she alleges he turned up to her apartment under the guise of having marketing ideas for the film.\n\n\"I opened the door terrified, brandishing my 20-pound Chihuahua mix in front of me, as though that would do any good.\"\n\nShe told Weinstein her new boyfriend was on the way round, after which he apparently became dejected and left.\n\nLouisette Geiss\n\nImage copyright CBS News Image caption Louisette Geiss holding a press conference on Tuesday\n\nThe actress and producer came forward on Tuesday to say she was attacked by Weinstein at the Sundance Film Festival in 2008.\n\nHe invited her to his office in a hotel for a meeting about a script she had written.\n\nHalf an hour into the meeting, he went to the bathroom and emerged wearing only a robe that was open at the front.\n\nShe claims he insisted on continuing to listen to her pitch in his hot tub, then asked her to watch him masturbate. When she told him she was leaving, he grabbed her arm, pulled her into the bathroom and told her he could green-light her script - if she watched him.\n\n\"I was on the verge of tears but I pulled it together and quickly exited,\" she said.\n\nRoseanna Arquette\n\nImage copyright Getty Images\n\nThe actress said that she rejected Weinstein's advances and that she believes her acting career suffered as a result.\n\nShe told the New York Times in the early 1990s Weinstein asked her to stop by the Beverly Hills Hotel to pick up a script for a role.\n\nShe was directed to his room where he was in a bathrobe and asked her for a massage.\n\nWhen she refused she claims he grabbed her hand and pulled it toward his crotch.\n\nMore voices\n\nThe first allegations made against Weinstein in the New York Time article were mainly from young women hoping to break into the film industry as well as the actresses Ashley Judd and Rose McGowan.\n\nOther actresses that have come forward since then with their stories about Weinstein include French actresses Florence Darel, Judith Godreche and Emma de Caunes.\n\nUS actresses Jessica Barth, Katherine Kendall and aspiring actresses Dawn Denning, who is now a costume designer, Tomi-Ann Roberts who is now a psychology professor, have also gone on the record with their accounts.\n\nTV anchor Lauren Sivan alleged Weinstein cornered her in an empty basement area of a New York restaurant in 2007 and pleasured himself in front of her.\n\nAnd other workers at the Weinstein film company told the New Yorker about their experiences including Emily Nestor who was a temporary front desk assistant who said she had to refuse his advances \"at least a dozen times\".\n\nWeinstein's spokeswoman Sallie Hofmeister issued a statement on Tuesday in response to the allegations of sexual harassment and assault.\n\n\"Any allegations of non-consensual sex are unequivocally denied by Mr Weinstein,\" she said. \"Mr Weinstein has further confirmed that there were never any acts of retaliation against any women for refusing his advances.\n\n\"Mr Weinstein obviously can't speak to anonymous allegations, but with respect to any women who have made allegations on the record, Mr Weinstein believes that all of these relationships were consensual. Mr Weinstein has begun counselling, has listened to the community and is pursuing a better path.\"\n\nFollow us on Facebook, on Twitter @BBCNewsEnts, or on Instagram at bbcnewsents.

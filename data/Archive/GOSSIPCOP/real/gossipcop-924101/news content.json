On the 36th floor of the towering 432 Park Avenue building (the tallest residential building in the Western Hemisphere), lies a gorgeous three-bedroom, 4.5-bathroom, 4,000-square-foot condo, sold to the celebs for a cool $15.316 million.\n\nBecause when you're J-Rod, you go big or go home.\n\n\n\nCourtesy of Street Easy\n\nDespite only reaching their one-year-mark this past February, according to StreetEasy the new homeowners actually started apartment-hunting together last fall, shopping around at 432 Park before landing on the perfect unit and pulling the trigger earlier this week.\n\nOf the apartment building, Page Six revealed that the couple was ultimately sold on the plethora of celebrity-style amenities, which include private parking, a personal chef serving three meals a day, a state-of-the-art gym with yoga and Pilates studios, sauna and steam room, a cinema and private elevators.\n\nCourtesy of Street Easy\n\nNo stranger to the high-priced New York real estate market, J.Lo dropped a pretty penny on a four-bedroom, six-bathroom, 6,540-square-foot duplex penthouse overlooking Madison Square Park in 2014, back when the actress was still married to Marc Anthony.\n\nShortly after Lopez and Rodriguez began shopping for a home together, Lopez sold her huge NYC pad for $26.95 million\u2014making her new $15.3 million property look like a steal.\n\nCourtesy of Street Easy\n\nOf the future for J-Rod, it would seem that buying a love nest together might be a step towards the M-word.\n\n\"I do believe in marriage, and I would love to grow old with somebody in a committed relationship,\" J.Lo revealed to Harper's Bazaar in the April issue. \"But I'm not forcing anything right now. It's good, it's healthy; we communicate well. We understand each other's lives in a way that most other people couldn't.\"\n\nA healthy adult relationship and now a shared home together\u2014 if wedding bells were in J-Rod's future\u2014we certainly wouldn't be mad about it.", "images": ["https://www.harpersbazaar.com/_assets/design-tokens/fre/static/icons/social/youtube.ce3e1ae.svg?primary=%2523ffffff&id=social-button-icon",

Celebrities have taken on the call to raise awareness and donations in support of those impacted by the devastation.\n\nJennifer Lopez and Marc Anthony hosted the star studded One Voice: Somos Live disaster relief concert in honor of their beloved Puerto Rico. Demi Lovato, DJ Khaled, Ricky Martin, Gwen Stefani, Alex Rodriguez, Mary J. Blige and Jamie Foxx were among the celebs who hit the stage to raise funds for those affected by Hurricane Maria in PR.\n\nLopez, who has donated $1 million to hurricane relief efforts, took to the stage stressing the importance of coming together in the face of adversity. She also took a not so subtle dig at Donald Trump's recent visit to Puerto Rico. \"There are some messes you can't clean up with paper towels,\" taunting the fact that Trump tossed rolls of paper towels at hurricane survivors.\n\nOne of the most recent updates from the relief benefit revealed that there had been over $20 million donated.\n\nKim Kardashian West, Ellen DeGeneres and Selena Gomez also took part in the fundraising efforts on behalf of the American Red Cross, Reach Out Worldwide, United Way, United for Puerto Rico and other charities.\n\nOther celebrities like Common, Ciara and Russell Wilson took to social media sharing their excitement for the event.", "images": ["https://images.paramount.tech/uri/mgid:arc:imageassetref:vh1.com:3cdef211-7973-46c0-8828-076bea8e6db5?quality=0.7&gen=ntrn&legacyStatusCode=true&format=jpg&width=1200&height=630&crop=true", "https://images.paramount.tech/uri/mgid:arc:imageassetref:vh1.com:3cdef211-7973-46c0-8828-076bea8e6db5?quality=0.7&gen=ntrn&legacyStatusCode=true&format=webp&height=180&width=320&crop=true", "https://images.paramount.tech/uri/mgid:arc:imageassetref:vh1.com:cc07a4e9-6aa7-4152-8953-1521fc5984a7?quality=0.7&gen=ntrn&legacyStatusCode=true", "https://images.paramount.tech/uri/mgid:arc:imageassetref:vh1.com:ebcdad67-0169-4bfe-9ce3-3d9aeec3794a?quality=0.7&gen=ntrn&legacyStatusCode=true", "https://images.paramount.tech/uri/mgid:arc:imageassetref:vh1.com:48c162d8-1d15-44be-a38a-0abecf78ad9a?quality=0.7&gen=ntrn&legacyStatusCode=true"], "top_img": "https://images.paramount.tech/uri/mgid:arc:imageassetref:vh1.com:3cdef211-7973-46c0-8828-076bea8e6db5?quality=0.7&gen=ntrn&legacyStatusCode=true&format=jpg&width=1200&height=630&crop=true", "keywords": [], "authors": [], "canonical_link": "https://www.vh1.com/news/mxdyjv/puerto-rico-relief-benefit-concert-somos-live", "title": "Jennifer Lopez, Marc Anthony and a Host of Stars Stand in Solidarity With Puerto Rico at the 'Somos Live!'", "meta_data": {"app_version": "d5e4a81f0-2833-2023-10-17", "robots": "noydir,noodp, max-image-preview:large", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=1, maximum-scale=2", "theme-color": "#87b6c0", "msapplication-config": "/browserconfig.xml", "description": "Celebrities attend the Somos Una Voz disaster relief concert to help Puerto Rico.", "original-source": "https://www.vh1.com/news/mxdyjv/puerto-rico-relief-benefit-concert-somos-live", "search": {"title": "Jennifer Lopez, Marc Anthony and a Host of Stars Stand in Solidarity With Puerto Rico at the 'Somos Live!'", "description": "Celebs use a united voice to help at the disaster relief concert.", "imageUrl": "https://images.paramount.tech/uri/mgid:arc:imageassetref:vh1.com:3cdef211-7973-46c0-8828-076bea8e6db5?quality=0.7&gen=ntrn&legacyStatusCode=true", "imageHeight": 574, "imageWidth": 1020, "url": "/news/mxdyjv/puerto-rico-relief-benefit-concert-somos-live", "contentType": "Article", "bucketName": "Article", "labelName": "News", "contentDate": "2017-10-15T17:43:41.000Z"}, "og": {"title": "Jennifer Lopez, Marc Anthony and a Host of Stars Stand in Solidarity With Puerto Rico at the 'Somos Live!'", "description": "Celebrities attend the Somos Una Voz disaster relief concert to help Puerto Rico.", "image": {"identifier": "https://images.paramount.tech/uri/mgid:arc:imageassetref:vh1.com:3cdef211-7973-46c0-8828-076bea8e6db5?quality=0.7&gen=ntrn&legacyStatusCode=true&format=jpg&width=1200&height=630&crop=true", "width": 1200, "height": 630}, "url": "https://www.vh1.com/news/mxdyjv/puerto-rico-relief-benefit-concert-somos-live", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "description": "Celebrities attend the Somos Una Voz disaster relief concert to help Puerto Rico.", "title": "Jennifer Lopez, Marc Anthony and a Host of Stars Stand in Solidarity With Puerto Rico at the 'Somos Live!'", "image": "https://images.paramount.tech/uri/mgid:arc:imageassetref:vh1.com:3cdef211-7973-46c0-8828-076bea8e6db5?quality=0.7&gen=ntrn&legacyStatusCode=true&format=jpg&width=1200&height=630&crop=true"}}, "movies": [], "publish_date": null, "source": "http://www.vh1.com", "summary": ""}

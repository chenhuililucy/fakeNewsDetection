Even Gadot made it.\n\nThe \u201cWonder Woman\u201d star played \u201cBox of Lies\u201d \u2014 a \u201cTonight Show\u201d game where Fallon and a guest attempted to stump each other on the contents of a mystery box. Most of the items, however, are hard to describe even truthfully.\n\nGadot won the game, but granted, some of the items made trying to confuse Fallon really easy. One item was a fake foot dressed up like a skiing mountain, complete with little skiiers. It\u2019s an item so bizarre that not even Gadot had any idea what to do.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t even know how to describe this,\u201d she laughed.\n\nShe eventually won the game (thanks to the aforementioned foot) and received the best prize as writer Seth Herzog came out and did an interpretive dance to the \u201cWonder Woman\u201d theme song \u2014 complete with Wonder Woman regalia.\n\nIt was a dance so spellbinding that at one point Fallon tried to cover Gadot\u2019s eyes. The actress had a very eventful night in the lead-up to the release of \u201cWonder Woman,\u201d the latest DCEU film set to hit theaters on June 2.\n\nWatch the full video above.", "images": ["https://www.thewrap.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/gal-gadot-jimmy-fallon.jpg", "https://i0.wp.com/www.thewrap.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Rahul-Kohli.png?resize=320%2C180&ssl=1", "https://i0.wp.com/www.thewrap.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Morning-Joe-on-gag-order-Trump.jpeg?resize=320%2C180&ssl=1", "https://i0.wp.com/www.thewrap.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/Roku-San-Jose-Headquarters.png?resize=320%2C180&ssl=1", "https://i0.wp.com/www.thewrap.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/boxing.jpg?resize=320%2C180&ssl=1", "https://i0.wp.com/www.thewrap.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Succession-EmmyWrap-Drama-Cover-1.jpg?fit=250%2C300&ssl=1"], "top_img": "https://www.thewrap.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/gal-gadot-jimmy-fallon.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Carli Velocci", "Loree Seitz", "Lucas Manfredi", "Benjamin Lindsay", "Kayla Cobb", ".Wp-Block-Post-Author Display Flex Flex-Wrap Wrap .Wp-Block-Post-Author__Byline Font-Size Margin-Bottom Margin-Top Width", ".Wp-Block-Post-Author__Avatar Margin-Right .Wp-Block-Post-Author__Bio Font-Size Margin-Bottom .Wp-Block-Post-Author__Content Flex-Basis Flex-Grow .Wp-Block-Post-Author__Name Margin", ".Wp-Block-Post-Author Font-Family Libre-Franklin Sans-Serif Font-Size Line-Height Align-Items Center Letter-Spacing White-Space Pre .Wp-Block-Post-Author A Color", "Text-Decoration None .Wp-Block-Post-Author A Hover .Wp-Block-Post-Author A Focus Text-Decoration Underline .Wp-Block-Post-Author__Byline Display Inline Font-Size Inherit -Webkit-Margin-End Margin-Inline-End Width -Moz-Max-Content Width Max-Content .Wp-Block-Post-Author__Avatar Border Solid", "Border-Radius"], "canonical_link": "https://www.thewrap.com/gal-gadot-fallon-lies-video/", "title": "Gal Gadot Plays 'Box of Lies' On 'Tonight Show'", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "robots": "index, follow, max-image-preview:large, max-snippet:-1, max-video-preview:-1", "og": {"locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "Gal Gadot Plays 'Box of Lies' On 'Tonight Show' - Insert Lasso of Truth Joke Here (Video) - TheWrap", "description": "The \"Wonder Woman\" star showed off her lying prowess", "url": "https://www.thewrap.com/gal-gadot-fallon-lies-video/", "site_name": "TheWrap", "image": {"identifier": "https://www.thewrap.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/gal-gadot-jimmy-fallon.jpg", "width": 618, "height": 412, "type": "image/jpeg"}}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/thewrap", "published_time": "2017-05-24T14:50:39+00:00", "modified_time": "2017-05-24T14:50:53+00:00"}, "author": "Carli Velocci", "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@velocciraptor", "site": "@thewrap", "label1": "Written by", "data1": "Carli Velocci", "label2": "Est. reading time", "data2": "1 minute"}, "generator": "WordPress 6.2.3", "parsely-title": "Gal Gadot Plays \u2018Box of Lies\u2019 On \u2018Tonight Show\u2019 \u2013 Insert Lasso of Truth Joke Here (Video)", "parsely-link": "https://www.thewrap.com/gal-gadot-fallon-lies-video/", "parsely-type": "post", "parsely-pub-date": "2017-05-24T07:50:39-07:00", "parsely-section": "tv", "parsely-author": "Carli Velocci", "parsely-tags": "gal-gadot, jimmy_fallon, the-tonight-show-starring-jimmy-fallon, wonder_woman", "msapplication-TileImage": "https://i0.wp.com/www.thewrap.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/thewrap-site-icon-1.png?fit=270%2C270&ssl=1"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1495637439.0, "source": "https://www.thewrap.com", "summary": ""}

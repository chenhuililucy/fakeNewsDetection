She said I was postnatally depressed and I went, 'Am I? Why is that?'\"\n\nThe three-time Emmy nominee has since worked through her setback, but it wasn't easy. \"I saw a great guy and he sorted me out, but I did the first year [on Game of Thrones] in that space, figuring out motherhood and going through a weird time personally,\" she adds. \"It was tricky.\"\n\nWATCH: Adele Opens Up on Her Battle With Postpartum Depression, Says She\u2019s No Longer a \u2018Massive Drinker\u2019\n\nIn 2014, Headey also spoke about her struggles following the birth of her first child. \"Then I had postnatal depression, which I didn't realize for a long time,\" she told The Telegraph. \"I went a bit nuts and eventually went to a guy who mixes Western and Eastern philosophy in terms of medicine and he put me on a course of something that changed everything. But I would never want to be dependent [on medication].\"\n\nHeadey -- who is also mom to daughter Teddy, who turns two next week -- isn't the first celebrity to speak out about postpartum depression.\n\n\n\nIn March, Chrissy Teigen wrote an essay for Glamour magazine about her struggle following the birth of her and John Legend's daughter, Luna. \"I was different than before. Getting out of bed to get to set on time was painful,\" the 31-year-old model admitted. \"My lower back throbbed; my shoulders, even my wrists, hurt. I didn\u2019t have an appetite. I would go two days without a bite of food, and you know how big of a deal food is for me.\"\n\n\n\nCheck out more of Teigen's essay:\n\n", "images": ["https://web.archive.org/web/20170706213422im_/http://www.etonline.com/music/2017/07/24341336/300_gavin_russom_grindr.jpg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20170706213422im_/http://www.etonline.com/media/video/2017/07/24341316/et_britney_070617_300.jpg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20170706213422im_/http://www.etonline.com/global/public/images/ETLogo.svg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20170706213422im_/http://www.etonline.com/media/photo/2014/04/24075114/640_natalie_thrones_module.jpg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20170706213422im_/http://www.etonline.com/photo/2017/07/24341257/lena_headey_454181328.jpg"], "top_img": "https://web.archive.org/web/20170706213422im_/http://www.etonline.com/photo/2017/07/24341257/lena_headey_454181328.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Jackie Willis", "Photo", "Getty Images"], "canonical_link": "https://web.archive.org/web/20170706213422/http://www.etonline.com/news/220976_lena_headey_recalls_battling_postpartum_depression_while_filming_game_of_thrones/", "title": "Lena Headey Recalls Battling Postpartum Depression While Filming 'Game of Thrones'", "meta_data": {"description": "\"I was postnatally depressed but I didn't know it.\"", "keywords": "Game of Thrones,Lena Headey,postpartum depression", "robots": "all", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "apple-mobile-web-app-capable": "yes", "og": {"title": "Lena Headey Recalls Battling Postpartum Depression While Filming 'Game of Thrones'", "type": "article", "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20170706213422/http://www.etonline.com/news/220976_lena_headey_recalls_battling_postpartum_depression_while_filming_game_of_thrones/", "image": {"identifier": "https://web.archive.org/web/20170706213422im_/http://www.etonline.com/photo/2017/07/24341257/lena_headey_454181328.jpg", "width": 1280, "height": 720}, "description": "\"I was postnatally depressed but I didn't know it.\"", "site_name": "Entertainment Tonight"}, "fb": {"admins": 3111204, "app_id": 145337045558621}, "twitter": {"account_id": 23603092, "site": "@etnow", "card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "Jackie Willis", "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20170706213422im_/http://www.etonline.com/news/220976_lena_headey_recalls_battling_postpartum_depression_while_filming_game_of_thrones/", "title": "Lena Headey Recalls Battling Postpartum Depression While Filming 'Game of Thrones'", "description": "\"I was postnatally depressed but I didn't know it.\"", "image": "https://web.archive.org/web/20170706213422im_/http://www.etonline.com/photo/2017/07/24341257/lena_headey_454181328.jpg"}}, "movies": [], "publish_date": null, "source": "https://web.archive.org", "summary": ""}

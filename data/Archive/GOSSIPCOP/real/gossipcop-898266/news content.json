Unscripted and Alternative Television.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m such a beauty-junkie and am fascinated by how artists are able to transform someone\u2019s look with makeup and couldn\u2019t be more ecstatic for them to show what they can really do,\u201d said executive producer, Kim Kardashian West.\n\nEach episode will feature four beauty bloggers who will go head-to-head to show they have the talent, charisma and vision it takes to be the next big name in the beauty world, all while facing expert judges who will critique every stroke of the contouring brush.

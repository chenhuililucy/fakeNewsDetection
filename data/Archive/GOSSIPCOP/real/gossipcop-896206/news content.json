In honor of the anniversary this past weekend, some of the animated classic's stars reminisced on social media.\n\nScott Weinger, the voice of Aladdin, took to Twitter to melt our hearts with a message to Jasmine (Linda Larkin).\n\n\"Hey Princess @MissLindaLarkin can you believe #Aladdin was released 25 years ago today?\" he wrote. \"I'd lie to you about being a prince just to fly you around the world on a Magic Carpet all over again.\"\n\nMore From Woman's Day\n\nThis content is imported from twitter.

Love you so much!\"\n\nLea Salonga, who provided Jasmine's singing voice, also paid tribute on Twitter.\n\nThis content is imported from twitter.

The clip shows Genie, the character her late father voiced, playfully squeezing Aladdin's face.\n\n\"Genie turned 25 yesterday. Little brother turns 26 today. Life is full of reminders that time passes so very fast,\" she wrote. \"Now, excuse me while I go reenact this with my baby brother's face.\"\n\nWe've never had a friend like you, Genie!\n\n(h/t ABC News)", "images": ["https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/trisha-yearwood-kitchen-reveal-1653591258.jpg?crop=0.671xw:1.00xh;0.165xw,0&resize=360:*", "https://hips.hearstapps.com/rover/profile_photos/d875c665-c775-4054-b926-c05d846f2ea4_1690465759.file?fill=1:1&resize=120:*", "https://hips.hearstapps.com/wdy.h-cdn.co/assets/17/48/1600x800/landscape-1511901986-aladdin.jpg?resize=640:*", "https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/169996-2963-6515e59c1973b.jpg?crop=1.00xw:0.669xh;0,0.00568xh&resize=360:*", "https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/brittany-mahomes-and-taylor-swift-watch-during-the-second-news-photo-1697196210.jpg?crop=0.668xw:1.00xh;0.128xw,0&resize=360:*", "https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/taylor-swift-blake-lively-65295d0b0f37c.png?crop=0.502xw:1.00xh;0.250xw,0&resize=360:*", "https://www.womansday.com/_assets/design-tokens/womansday/static/images/logos/network-logo.b673d37.svg?primary=%2523ffffff", "https://www.womansday.com/_assets/design-tokens/womansday/static/images/logos/logo.062a1eb.svg?primary=%2523000000", "https://www.womansday.com/_assets/design-tokens/womansday/static/images/logos/logo.062a1eb.svg?primary=navLogoColor", "https://www.womansday.com/_assets/design-tokens/fre/static/icons/social/twitter.b9a5c19.svg?primary=currentColor&id=link-out-embed", "https://www.womansday.com/_assets/design-tokens/fre/static/icons/social/youtube.ce3e1ae.svg?primary=currentColor&id=link-out-embed", "https://www.womansday.com/_assets/design-tokens/fre/static/icons/social/youtube.ce3e1ae.svg?primary=%2523000000&id=social-button-icon", "https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/travis-kelce-and-taylor-swift-depart-the-snl-afterparty-on-news-photo-1697456617.jpg?crop=0.700xw:1.00xh;0.122xw,0&resize=360:*", "https://hips.hearstapps.com/rover/profile_photos/d875c665-c775-4054-b926-c05d846f2ea4_1690465759.file?fill=1:1&resize=160:*", "https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/celebrity-chef-bobby-flay-and-his-cat-nacho-flay-visit-the-news-photo-1697559539.jpg?crop=0.578xw:0.401xh;0.246xw,0.0520xh&resize=360:*", "https://www.womansday.com/_assets/design-tokens/fre/static/icons/social/twitter.b9a5c19.svg?primary=%2523000000&id=social-button-icon", "https://hips.hearstapps.com/wdy.h-cdn.co/assets/17/48/1511900257-scott-weigner-then-and-now.jpg?resize=980:*", "https://www.womansday.com/_assets/design-tokens/fre/static/icons/social/pinterest.e8cf655.svg?primary=%2523000000&id=social-button-icon", "https://hips.hearstapps.com/wdy.h-cdn.co/assets/17/48/768x384/landscape-1511911228-sad-genie-hugs-aladdin.png?resize=1200:*", "https://www.womansday.com/_assets/design-tokens/fre/static/icons/social/instagram.f282b14.svg?primary=currentColor&id=link-out-embed", "https://hips.hearstapps.com/vidthumb/manual_upload/5903b988d5593031ace8d661/thumb_1493416333.png?crop=1xw:1xh;center,top&resize=480:*", "https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/gettyimages-138362190-1502780216.jpg?crop=0.676xw:1.00xh;0.163xw,0&resize=360:*", "https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/taylor-travis-gettyimages-1677323526-65047cd294e48.jpg?crop=0.482xw:0.965xh;0.518xw,0&resize=360:*", "https://hips.hearstapps.com/wdy.h-cdn.co/assets/17/48/1511909301-aladdin-and-genie.gif?resize=640:*", "https://www.womansday.com/_assets/design-tokens/fre/static/icons/social/facebook.a5a3a69.svg?primary=%2523000000&id=social-button-icon", "https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/shark-tank-lori-greiner-husband-dan-marriage-6516fe84e6f11.jpeg?crop=0.744xw:0.572xh;0.171xw,0.0567xh&resize=360:*", "https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/wheel-of-fortune-vanna-white-maggie-sajak-replacement-comment-652571a6ae3fc.jpeg?crop=0.436xw:0.291xh;0.292xw,0.0897xh&resize=360:*", "https://www.womansday.com/_assets/design-tokens/fre/static/icons/social/instagram.f282b14.svg?primary=%2523000000&id=social-button-icon", "https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/bgus-2751695-012-652bd7e3bfca8.jpg?crop=1.00xw:0.667xh;0,0.161xh&resize=360:*", "https://www.womansday.com/_assets/design-tokens/fre/static/icons/social/pinterest.e8cf655.svg?primary=%2523ffffff", "https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/virgin-river-season-6-6526ab83c4a97.jpg?crop=0.502xw:1.00xh;0.332xw,0&resize=360:*"], "top_img": "https://hips.hearstapps.com/wdy.h-cdn.co/assets/17/48/768x384/landscape-1511911228-sad-genie-hugs-aladdin.png?resize=1200:*", "keywords": [], "authors": [], "canonical_link": "https://www.womansday.com/life/entertainment/a60795/25th-anniversary-of-aladdin/", "title": "Cast of 'Aladdin' Celebrates 25th Anniversary on Twitter", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "X-UA-Compatible": "IE=edge,chrom=1", "msapplication-tap-highlight": "no", "title": "Cast of 'Aladdin' Celebrates 25th Anniversary on Twitter -

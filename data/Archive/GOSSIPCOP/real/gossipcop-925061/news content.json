Of course, Darcell didn\u2019t get partake.\n\nWe\u2019re told the pregnancy announcement was a huge success. Darcell\u2019s family wasn\u2019t at the show but she immediately texted them a video and they \u201cfreaked out,\u201d naturally.\n\nCongratulations \u2026 looks like someone already has a Godfather!", "images": ["https://d3stcg8iy7fvse.cloudfront.net/2023/10/17062531/Erin-Andrews-Taylor-Swift-Travis-Kelce.jpg?aspect_ratio=390:219&width=390", "https://d3stcg8iy7fvse.cloudfront.net/2021/05/social_share.png", "https://d3stcg8iy7fvse.cloudfront.net/2022/06/MEGA793999_024-scaled-e1656949241151.jpg?aspect_ratio=2:1&width=180", "https://d3stcg8iy7fvse.cloudfront.net/2022/12/James_Cameron_Matt_Damon_Get_Over_Avatar_Role_Loss.png?aspect_ratio=390:219&width=390", "https://d3stcg8iy7fvse.cloudfront.net/2021/06/theblast-logo.png", "https://d3stcg8iy7fvse.cloudfront.net/2023/10/11080518/Britney-Spears-and-Justin-Timberblake-3.png?aspect_ratio=2:1&width=180", "https://d3stcg8iy7fvse.cloudfront.net/2022/11/Snoop-Dogg-1-scaled-e1669661156894.jpeg?aspect_ratio=2:1&width=180", "https://d3stcg8iy7fvse.cloudfront.net/2023/10/17112113/Conor-McGregor-MMA-Return-scaled-e1697566890840.jpg?aspect_ratio=390:219&width=390", "https://d3stcg8iy7fvse.cloudfront.net/2023/10/17115334/Aaron-Rodgers-1-scaled-e1697568831299.jpg?aspect_ratio=390:219&width=390", "https://d3stcg8iy7fvse.cloudfront.net/2023/04/Joe-Jonas-Sophie-Turner-scaled-e1682102316264.jpg?aspect_ratio=390:219&width=390", "https://d3stcg8iy7fvse.cloudfront.net/2023/02/Justin-Timberlake-Jessica-Biel-scaled-e1675282754593.jpg?aspect_ratio=2:1&width=180", "https://d3stcg8iy7fvse.cloudfront.net/2022/12/Kylie-Jenner-scaled-e1671268293226.jpeg?aspect_ratio=390:219&width=390", "https://d3stcg8iy7fvse.cloudfront.net/2022/11/Maren-Morris-and-Ryan-Hurd-scaled-e1668351543261.jpg?aspect_ratio=390:219&width=390", "https://d3stcg8iy7fvse.cloudfront.net/2022/11/mega900253_001-scaled-e1667337753781.jpg?aspect_ratio=390:219&width=390", "https://d3stcg8iy7fvse.cloudfront.net/2022/03/MEGA328409_699-scaled-e1648160827205.jpg?aspect_ratio=2:1&width=180", "https://d3stcg8iy7fvse.cloudfront.net/previous/adf9e91eb8ee6f407aeb55d38dd9887b.jpg?aspect_ratio=13:6&width=1300", "https://d3stcg8iy7fvse.cloudfront.net/2023/10/08082244/Conor-McGregor-UFC-Return-Paperwork-scaled-e1697584365380.jpg?aspect_ratio=390:219&width=390", "https://d3stcg8iy7fvse.cloudfront.net/2023/01/ptsphotoshottwo719990-scaled-e1674559490416.jpg?aspect_ratio=390:219&width=390"], "top_img": "https://d3stcg8iy7fvse.cloudfront.net/2021/05/social_share.png", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Theblast Staff"], "canonical_link": "https://theblast.com/55070/justin-timberlake-concert-fan-announce-pregnancy/", "title": "Justin Timberlake Stops Concert for Epic Pregnancy Announcement", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "robots": "index, follow, max-image-preview:large, max-snippet:-1, max-video-preview:-1", "og": {"locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "Justin Timberlake Stops Concert for Epic Pregnancy Announcement", "description": "Justin Timberlake stopped his concert to help a lucky fan make one of the biggest announcements of her life.

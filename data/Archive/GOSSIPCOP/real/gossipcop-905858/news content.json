He was Christian science his entire life. He never had medicine his whole life. Never went to a doctor. I never had a vaccination. We never had medicine growing up, and he lived to be 92.\n\n\u201cHe was very proud of me. He loved this show, and he was a kind man, a very accepting man. There was not one bone of judgement in his body,\u201d she said. \u201cHe was very funny. I think my brother Vance and I got our sense of humor from him.\u201d\n\nDeGeneres, 59, said that her father's death was not unexpected. She went on to say that she and her dad, a former insurance salesman, had a special bond and that he was particularly fond of her work in the entertainment business, especially since their family had taken a trip to tour Warner Bros. studio when she was young.\n\nRelated: Ellen DeGeneres fights back tears talking about the deadly mudslide that devastated California\n\n\u201cWe only took one family vacation. When I was a little girl, we came to this lot, to the Warner Bros. lot, and took the tour and went around. And now I work on the Warner Bros. lot and have my own stage with my name on it, so he was really proud of that,\u201d she said. \u201cBefore he passed away, I got to talk to him, so I got to say goodbye to him, and I was leaving the building and I looked back and there was a rainbow over the Warner Bros. studio.\u201d\n\nThis week, at the age of 92, my father Elliott DeGeneres passed away. He lived a good long life. It wasn\u2019t unexpected. I was able to say goodbye. pic.twitter.com/L0zEJJNPrq \u2014 Ellen DeGeneres (@TheEllenShow) January 11, 2018 When I was a kid, my dad took us on one vacation to Warner Bros. Studios.

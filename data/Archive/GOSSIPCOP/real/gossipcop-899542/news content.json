But if you are made fun of, just don't let it bother you. Stay strong I guess. It's hard. But it'll probably get better one day.\"\n\nThat day might just be today.\n\nAs of Sunday evening, Keaton's video had more than 18.5 million views and had been shared more than 369,000 times on Facebook.

He said he couldn't give specifics.\n\n\"I\u2019m sorry it\u2019s like this,\" Clay said. \"We all sympathize with Keaton and we\u2019re doing everything we can to make sure it never happens again. Everybody saw the video and it was horrible. We don\u2019t want anyone to feel like that. Keaton\u2019s a good kid. We\u2019ll take care of him.\"\n\nThe USA TODAY NETWORK - Tennessee has not been able to reach Kimberly Jones.\n\nThe reaction\n\nJarrett Guarantano, a University of Tennessee Vols quarterback, tweeted a picture with his \"new best bud\" on Sunday evening.\n\n\"So I got the chance to spend the day with my new best bud Keaton,\" Guarantano wrote. \"It was unbelievable to get to know him and realize that we have a lot in common. This dude is very special and has changed my life forever. Now I have the little brother I always wanted! God bless you my man.\"\n\nDana White said he wants to bring Keaton to Las Vegas to hang out at UFC headquarters.

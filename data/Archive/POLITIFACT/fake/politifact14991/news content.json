A native-born family, the Bordens ran a mill in what became the town for generations before and after the American revolution. Industrialization began when Col. Joseph Durfee, a native-born Revolutionary War hero built the first factory in 1811. Later, at the end of the 19th Century a wave of immigrants swelled the town\u2019s population. Immigrants, however, never made up a majority of the population of Bristol County, where Fall River lies, even at their early 20th Century peak.", "images": ["https://media.breitbart.com/media/2021/05/jeff-landry-ap-200x150.jpg", "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2023/10/israel-tank-column-getty-200x150.jpg", "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2018/01/ThePrivileged1-640x480.jpg", "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2023/09/Joe-Biden-1-200x150.jpeg", "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2023/10/pope-netanyahu-200x150.jpg", "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2021/05/Durbin-200x150.jpg", "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2023/10/Jamaall-Bowman-200x150.jpg", "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2023/03/Michael-Caine-200x150.jpg", "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2023/10/joe-biden-open-border-getty-200x150.jpg", "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2023/10/GettyImages-1722951607-1-200x150.jpg", "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2023/10/Hamas-terrorists-Getty-200x150.jpg", "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2023/10/Presidential-candidate-Daniel-Noboa-celebrates-with-wife-Angela-Lavinia-Valbonesi-getty-200x150.jpg", "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2023/09/Second-GOP-Primary-Presidential-Debate-640x480-1-200x150.jpg", "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2023/07/Brandon-Johnson-closeup-press-conference-getty-200x150.jpg", "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2021/05/Hezbollah-200x150.png", "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2023/10/GettyImages-1726782490-e1697459633918-200x150.jpg", "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2018/01/ThePrivileged1.jpg", "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2023/10/GettyImages-1705052813-200x150.jpg", "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2023/10/GettyImages-1722754292-200x150.jpg", "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2023/10/GettyImages-1554329285-200x150.jpg"], "top_img": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2018/01/ThePrivileged1.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Ian Mason"], "canonical_link": "https://www.breitbart.com/live/state-union-fact-check-analysis-livewire/fact-check-no-falls-river-massachusetts-was-not-built-by-immigrants/", "title": "Fact-Check: No, Fall River, Massachusetts, Was Not \u2018Built by Immigrants\u2019", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=722987199", "google-play-app": "app-id=com.breitbart.app", "theme-color": "#FF5500", "ahrefs-site-verification": "e5213d6c4a07fe85baa34006f2a9a3c977bd8f3a50fd0ab6d2aa93844e0b3303", "fb": {"pages": 95475020353, "app_id": 1243316582352556}, "description": "Rep.
